1
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,580
 Listen well, Osman Bey! 

2
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
 Be my Sancak Bey. 

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,440
 Vibrate the world. 

4
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,620
 Not yourself Sancak Bey ... 

5
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
 You look for a dog to tie a leash around your neck like Alishar. 

6
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,080
 The word comes out of Balgay's mouth once. 

7
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,480
 When it comes out, the blessed mountains tremble. 

8
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,140
 Mountains come from a string of stones. 

9
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,420
 Do not you know that we are melting the mountains and looking into many world judges? 

10
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 To the seas ... 

11
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,600
 I would like to say every inch of soil. 

12
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,680
 Every castle, every city ... 

13
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,000
 And finally Constantine. 

14
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,660
 Your appetite dazzles many fools. 

15
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
 But the blood in my vein ... 

16
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,780
 I will teach you that you will not bow to anyone forever. 

17
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,500
 How dare you? 

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
 I came across ... 

19
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
 Where do you get the power of cutting, Ahman? 

20
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,940
 To me... 

21
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
 Obey! Osman! 

22
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 Obey it ... 

23
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
 Not the scent of the goats of the Alps ... 

24
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
 You can smell the scent of blood. 

25
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,720
 The day I obeyed you ... 

26
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,500
 It is the day that the ceremony of the Turk died. 

27
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,780
 I'm your ceremony ... 

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I mud under my boot. 

29
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
 The carcass of people like you ... 

30
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,180
 I headed to my room. 

31
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
 What about death ... 

32
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
 Or obedience. 

33
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,280
 What a pity ... 

34
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,980
 Ya liberty! 

35
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
 Tell your grasshoppers to bring us water. 

36
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,200
 Our mouth and palate dried out of breath. 

37
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
 I'll lay the mud in my drawing for you Turkish! 

38
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,920
 You handle it. 

39
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,060
 Let's see if you can say this while playing with your pusat gras? 

40
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,720
 Mr. Dundar, I'm Day! 

41
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,400
 Mr. Bamsı ... 

42
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,120
 Where is Osman? 

43
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
 How is my brother, Bamsı? 

44
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,120
 He talks to Balgay. 

45
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,940
 Obviously Balgay has the will to Osman. 

46
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
 What is my day, obada hal? 

47
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,580
 Oba is in place. 

48
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
 However, his honor has collapsed. 

49
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,220
 I don't know how to live with this black destiny, Bamsı. 

50
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
 Shut up! 

51
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
 Prepared. 

52
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,760
 We will attack our teeth with our fingernails and take their pusat. 

53
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,820
 If necessary, we will go to Osman. 

54
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,080
 Open your eyes. 

55
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,020
 Thank you sir. 

56
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,440
 You should wait here. 

57
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
 Or die with your alps ... 

58
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,680
 Or your soul is great in this land. 

59
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,340
 The decision is yours. 

60
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,620
 Commander Balgay. 

61
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,280
 I went to the Oba. 

62
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 Balgay's might ... 

63
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,700
 Everybody felt it. 

64
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,740
 Beautiful. 

65
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 Now there is the New Market. 

66
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,960
 Bring Sheikh Edebalı alive to me. 

67
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 The delegate's delegate ... 

68
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,440
 May decorate the New Market. 

69
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
 I wanted your mouth to be sweet. 

70
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,200
 I brought water. 

71
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,380
 My Sheikh ... 

72
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
 I have what I mean by confiscation. 

73
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,140
 My misdemeanor is great ... 

74
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,100
 I exceeded my limit ... 

75
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
 I broke his word ... 

76
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 I understand, but I'm late. 

77
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,920
 I'm in need of forgiveness. 

78
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,160
 The difference between the devil and man ... 

79
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,400
 Where is Bala? 

80
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,740
 God... 

81
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,320
 Before Satan Adam ... 

82
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,640
 He ordered him to prostrate. 

83
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,100
 The devil did not listen. 

84
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,740
 He became a sinner. 

85
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,120
 God... 

86
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
 Forbidden fruit to Adam ... 

87
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,220
 He ordered him to stay away. 

88
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
 Adam did not listen. 

89
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
 He became a sinner. 

90
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,320
 Both of them... 

91
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
 It broke the biggest word ... 

92
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,980
 But the devil ... 

93
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,180
 While he couldn't take his head out of his arrogance ... 

94
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,500
 Adam... 

95
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,560
 He repented. 

96
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,680
 He asked forgiveness. 

97
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,620
 Apologize... 

98
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,680
 Decent. 

99
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,960
 My God... 

100
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
 Maybe most ... 

101
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,720
 He loves his pardoners. 

102
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
 But... 

103
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,880
 There is someone he loves more than him ... 

104
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,980
 Wishing forgiveness ... 

105
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,880
 Not repeating the same mistake. 

106
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,880
 What about you ... 

107
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,180
 Will you forgive me? 

108
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,140
 We are not forgiveness, Bala. 

109
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,240
 Forgiving... 

110
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
 But it is Allah. 

111
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,000
 We welcome you ... 

112
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
 We are obliged to love. 

113
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
 Our love for you ... 

114
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
 It is not straightforward. 

115
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,280
 Joyful... 

116
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,780
 You are our son with your mistake. 

117
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,060
 You CANIMM. 

118
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 Thank God my Lord ... 

119
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,600
 The mind ... 

120
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
 Respectfully to ... 

121
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
 Decorated with clean heart. 

122
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,960
 We would like ... 

123
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,620
 You keep them. 

124
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
 It's not for ourselves either ... 

125
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
 We would like for you again. 

126
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,900
 My father! 

127
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,960
 I'll be a victim to you. 

128
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,620
 Even the breath I take when you turn away hurts. 

129
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,500
 My lung burns. 

130
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,200
 You are entrusted to me by my Lord. 

131
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
 And you're a gift, Bala. 

132
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,860
 Your heart is clean. 

133
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 Your intention is pure. 

134
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,620
 I know. 

135
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,580
 From now on he will try not to deviate directly ... 

136
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
 I am sure of my heart. 

137
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
 You see, does he suck our black luck? 

138
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 We were captured in our own homeland. 

139
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,060
 Mostly ... 

140
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
 These mountains are my nephew. 

141
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
 I couldn't claim my brother's trust. 

142
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,080
 What a pity ... 

143
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
 Ya liberty! 

144
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,100
 Kill him! 

145
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 I will make hair on my pusat from your skin. 

146
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
 He wanted Balgay Edebalı. 

147
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,940
 We must get to the market before them. 

148
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
 Let's! 

149
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,680
 Why is it difficult to ride a grumpy horse ... 

150
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,460
 It is so hard to serve the guests on the feet. 

151
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,820
 You... 

152
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,080
 I knocked a lame scab like a dog ... 

153
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,280
 You will enjoy the treat I offer. 

154
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,500
 The horny jackal called Osman showed me that ... 

155
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,400
 If you breath the Turks ... 

156
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
 Your breath ... 

157
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,060
 Kutlu is Mongolian blood ... 

158
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
 It hit our face. 

159
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
 Lift those sinister heads. 

160
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,460
 Day! 

161
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,180
 My nephew! 

162
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
 Now, Mr. Dundar. 

163
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,800
 Osman's account that did not obey me ... 

164
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
 In order not to ask you ... 

165
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 Just one reason. 

166
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,380
 They broke the obe, the apocalypse broke. 

167
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,200
 Genocide who captured Dündar and Gündüz! 

168
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
 Look at the situation we're in. 

169
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,460
 Sons! 

170
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 Valiant dear! 

171
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,440
 Now it is not afar day. 

172
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,520
 We buried these cruel dogs in the ground in time. 

173
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,320
 Now is the time to fight yitesiye. 

174
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
 Now with anger ... 

175
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,840
 With patience and reason ... 

176
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
 It is time to fight love. 

177
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,520
 They brought my brother and sister to obey. 

178
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,580
 Now they will pay allegiance ... 

179
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 The Mongolian target is Edebalı ... 

180
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
 But if they harm Edebalı ... 

181
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
 Then they put out our lore quarry. 

182
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,860
 I Uthman ... 

183
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,180
 What do we stop then? 

184
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,120
 Let our sky be in red and sword! 

185
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 Allahu akbar! 

186
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,800
 Osman! 

187
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,940
 Osman is my cousin ... 

188
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,920
 Young is ... 

189
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,540
 It is crazy ... 

190
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
 We are not on the branch of the tree ... 

191
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,360
 We look at the root of the shepherd's head Dundar. 

192
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,080
 Why didn't you tell your niece the wrath of Mongolian? 

193
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
 We said, we said, but ... 

194
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
 We could not listen. 

195
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,660
 Gündüz has nothing to do with this job ... 

196
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
 Don't let my nephew hurt you. 

197
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
 Dundar is one reason for me. 

198
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,740
 One reason. 

199
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,980
 We did not know that this would be so. 

200
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,040
 We did not know that Osman would go astray. 

201
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,260
 Then a ... 

202
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
 Our ancestor Cengiz ... 

203
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,440
 We came here ... 

204
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,000
 Burning, destroying, asking for an account! 

205
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 In one disobedience ... 

206
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 He makes drums from your skin ... 

207
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,720
 I would ring at Söğüt square for worship. 

208
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,960
 To me... 

209
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,220
 You will obey unconditionally Dundar. 

210
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,720
 I understand certain obedience. 

211
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,100
 I will obey you. 

212
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,680
 To me... 

213
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
 You will bring Osman ... 

214
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,260
 You will show your obedience like that. 

215
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,280
 You... 

216
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,860
 Osman to you ... 

217
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
 I'll bring. 

218
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,800
 Three days. 

219
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,900
 Otherwise, I wash the oban. 

220
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
 Now take your nephew ... 

221
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
 There is go, say oba ... 

222
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,720
 Mongolian... 

223
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
 I will never return ... 

224
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,780
 Came back. 

225
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
 Get up during the day. 

226
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
 Come on up. 

227
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,360
 Come on, take it. 

228
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
 Valiant chicks of beech ... 

229
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,380
 The day is crying and whining ... 

230
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 It's not the day to retreat to tents. 

231
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,100
 Don't wake up the day ... 

232
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
 To show the strength of beech in Mongolian ... 

233
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,360
 Day is. 

234
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,620
 Tell the brothers ... 

235
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
 Let them be set to international lines. 

236
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
 We will be ready at any time. 

237
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,960
 Thank you Selcan Hatun. 

238
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,680
 It is not known whether our privates will return. 

239
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
 But we know that ... 

240
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,480
 The return is only to Allah. 

241
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,560
 Mongolian's gadget comes to the oba ... 

242
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,500
 Our task is to show that we will not bow. 

243
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 In the apricot chicks ... 

244
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
 He will fight like sooner ... 

245
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
 It is about beating dogs! 

246
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 We left at Horosan ... 

247
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
 Oath to the roots of Oghuz ... 

248
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
 We will not be neck! 

249
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
 We will vomit death! 

250
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
 The day is war! 

251
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,780
 Ahis is ready my Sheikh. 

252
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 They will act as your command. 

253
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,660
 Thank you. 

254
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,320
 They exist. 

255
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,120
 What's up? 

256
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,840
 Balgay. 

257
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
 My Sheikh, who had ridden the Willow with his soldiers. 

258
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,960
 He captured Dündar Bey and Gündüz Bey and brought them before them. 

259
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
 Nice alps wrapped around the carpets ... 

260
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,460
 He made him chew his horse, hung it. 

261
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,240
 In the time of Baccarat, my Lord says ... 

262
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,480
 Praise be ... 

263
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
 We are looking forward to you with some fear ... 

264
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
 Hunger and a piece of goods ... 

265
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,780
 From the souls and the semerat ... 

266
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
 We will test with deficiencies. 

267
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,220
 Good news to those who show patience ... 

268
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,200
 Only them ... 

269
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,720
 It will achieve success and success. 

270
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,500
 Zulfikar ... 

271
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,120
 Let the Ahis know also. 

272
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
 It is our duty to take precautions. 

273
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,000
 Where are we going? 

274
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
 We will not go. 

275
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,240
 We'll get up. 

276
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
 If this extreme falls in the land ... 

277
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
 Now for Muslims ... 

278
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,380
 Hope means exhausted. 

279
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,420
 Mongols are coming! 

280
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
 I want Edebalı right ... 

281
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
 Mow the rest close. 

282
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
 The benefit of the case is the day of honor. 

283
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
 I want Edebalı right. 

284
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
 For the rest. 

285
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,460
 Osman. 

286
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
 I ate my Sheikh. 

287
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
 Osman! 

288
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
 We draw the Alps. 

289
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
 You take off Edebalı, I will embroider them. 

290
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,420
 Do not kill, I want it right. 

291
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,020
 I liked you. 

292
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,740
 See to my tooth. 

293
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,360
 Be careful... 

294
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
 Let your body break ... 

295
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
 Don't let your jaw break. 

296
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
 You saved them ... 

297
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,680
 Now who will save you from me? 

298
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
 What were you saying in Alişar's mansion? 

299
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,860
 I remembered. 

300
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,540
 I am a witness of everything ... 

301
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,180
 You were saying. 

302
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,720
 However, you did not witness everything, Salvador. 

303
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,340
 E.g... 

304
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,800
 What can my anger do ... 

305
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,580
 You do not know. 

306
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,960
 It still sounds. 

307
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,620
 Beautiful. 

308
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,820
 Listen to the princess. 

309
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,200
 Please tell. 

310
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,840
 I'm listening. 

311
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,540
 Princess. 

312
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
 What you have to say ... 

313
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
 You said it in the mansion. 

314
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,820
 Now it's time to pay the price. 

315
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
 As I get bored ... 

316
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,080
 Come ... 

317
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,940
 I will remove your nails one by one. 

318
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,480
 Stop! 

319
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,280
 Princess. 

320
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,540
 You don't know the big secret. 

321
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,860
 Are you okay? 

322
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,560
 Osman... 

323
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
 He sent me here to gather information. 

324
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,260
 He's waiting for news from me. 

325
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,300
 You... 

326
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,160
 You will know what you want. 

327
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,900
 Just think. 

328
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,080
 Sir... 

329
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,180
 This compass has just arrived. 

330
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,740
 Mongolians. 

331
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Compass from Alişar. 

332
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,240
 Our Mongol commander will be our guest, Balgay. 

333
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,640
 This dog ... 

334
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
 And listen to the master Yannis. 

335
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,340
 Don't let him die. 

336
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
 I built these mountains, Osman Bey. 

337
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,640
 You don't sweat. 

338
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
 Samsa Sergeant ... 

339
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
 I Bismillahirahmanirah. 

340
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
 Ya Şafi! 

341
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,180
 Osman Bey is ready. 

342
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
 I hope my bravery. 

343
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,240
 He was protecting man from death. 

344
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,980
 You came to our rescue like Hızır. 

345
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
 Thank God my Lord forgave you. 

346
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Do they put the honor brother alive, sir? 

347
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,260
 The taste of your blood ... 

348
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
 He says he's a person sooner. 

349
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
 But obviously your mind is scarce. 

350
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,740
 The Turkish ... 

351
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,380
 All of you will pay for the delivery of your homeland. 

352
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
 I'm the only one ... 

353
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
 I want the only answer, miserable Turkish. 

354
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
 Where is Osman? 

355
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
 You'll call him, but ... 

356
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,300
 He finds you. 

357
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
 You will see it soon. 

358
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,520
 Who went up the mountain ... 

359
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,080
 Who's up the hill. 

360
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,460
 Where is Osman? 

361
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,320
 Where you will go. 

362
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,260
 They hit the fire of fear in everyone's heart. 

363
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
 They discouraged. 

364
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
 They also raided Oba. 

365
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,240
 Isn't this the case in Bamsı? 

366
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
 Death kills ... 

367
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
 Kneeling in fear ... 

368
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,140
 To the man who hopes his nation ... 

369
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,860
 They say sooner. 

370
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,480
 Let's see this test ... 

371
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,200
 Which stacks of our nation will shine. 

372
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
 Thank you premium. 

373
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,820
 Well... 

374
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,320
 What is the quality of this brave ... 

375
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,280
 Wins the test. 

376
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,940
 Estafurullah. 

377
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
 This is a heavy question, Bamsı Bey. 

378
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
 Bey is what you call recital. 

379
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,360
 First of all, the product he will grow ... 

380
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,940
 He will know which soil to plant. 

381
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,580
 In what season of seed ... 

382
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
 He will know that he will meet with the earth. 

383
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,680
 When will he give water ... 

384
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,600
 He will know how to cultivate the soil. 

385
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,900
 To horny herbs that do not know the seed sprouting ... 

386
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,800
 It will not give an opportunity. 

387
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,260
 While performing all these duties ... 

388
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,180
 Over ... 

389
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,860
 Strive to ... 

390
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
 It will not lose its sincerity. 

391
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,480
 The day will come, the seeds will bloom ... 

392
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
 Harvest will be obtained. 

393
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,580
 Products will find value. 

394
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,520
 That day, this huge garden ... 

395
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
 These products are my ... 

396
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,160
 Bamsı Bey will not say the work of my labor. 

397
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,120
 Who is in this fabric .. 

398
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,620
 In this morality ... 

399
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,880
 If this sacrifice happens ... 

400
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,180
 My Lord will be the companion of that valiant. 

401
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
 Tonight we will crash on them. 

402
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,080
 We will act the grave of Söğüt to them. 

403
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,520
 We will avenge our brothers. 

404
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
 Honor will stand upright. 

405
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,720
 Resistance will. 

406
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,640
 Samsa Sergeant ... 

407
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,480
 Mr. Osman. 

408
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
 It is not time to go to bed. 

409
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,060
 Let's go and save Onuralp. 

410
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,360
 I'm fine. 

411
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,560
 Erkut hayrola? 

412
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
 Nizamettin, the new market manager ... 

413
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,640
 Tell me what happened? 

414
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,820
 Yannis's man is out, sir. 

415
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,780
 Tell Master Yannis ... 

416
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,720
 The preachers of Edebalı will follow the Embri road. 

417
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,480
 Alişar Bey will do whatever is necessary for the families not to come. 

418
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,080
 You go and I throw the carcasses into a stream. 

419
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,120
 Tell Master Yannis the secret has not been revealed. 

420
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
 My dervish dervish. 

421
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,620
 Where is the dervish now, son? 

422
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,440
 I took it to Samsa Bey's oba. 

423
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,780
 It is safe. 

424
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,800
 Nizamettin's carcass ... 

425
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,120
 Tie it behind the horse and send it to Söğüt. 

426
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,780
 Send ... 

427
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,360
 Let them see who the real owner is. 

428
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,820
 My command, my head, sir. 

429
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,860
 Where is Osman and Edebalı? 

430
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,800
 They fled. 

431
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,400
 This was very bad. 

432
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,540
 At this end, you missed the two guys you will deal with most. 

433
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
 Nobody can escape from the Mongolian pusat, Alişar. 

434
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
 Eventually they will come out of the hole they entered. 

435
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
 You don't know them. 

436
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,420
 It is necessary to find the momentum. 

437
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,420
 Don't worry about them. 

438
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,900
 Commander Balgay is waiting for you. 

439
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,460
 Put your mind on you, mom. 

440
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,360
 Aunt. 

441
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,060
 We cannot combat with these. 

442
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,120
 However, an ambush to be installed in Balgay will disrupt his balance. 

443
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,720
 Just let such a brave come out. 

444
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,020
 Who is this brave? 

445
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,040
 Osman? 

446
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,000
 Once upon a time, we had braves who saw many days. 

447
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,620
 Now Osman will save us from Mongolian bandits? 

448
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,600
 In this land ... 

449
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,340
 Bey. 

450
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,660
 Father. 

451
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,960
 What happened, sir? 

452
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,540
 What will it be, chick? 

453
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,500
 Azrael ... 

454
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,520
 It entered our room ... 

455
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,500
 Whenever he wanted ... 

456
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
 He will take the life he desires. 

457
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,200
 I will cut this pus from the root of our soil. 

458
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,980
 I will make this land free ... 

459
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,440
 Or I will be martyred. 

460
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,480
 Where are we, we get there and head. 

461
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,940
 No no... 

462
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,700
 I will handle this work myself. 

463
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,980
 Stand behind Dündar Bey in my absence. 

464
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,500
 Where is Osman? 

465
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,740
 You can see whatever it is. 

466
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
 That is the reason for all this! 

467
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,300
 If you had pulled your ship in time, we wouldn't have been in this situation. 

468
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,420
 Shut up, babe! 

469
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,560
 Let me not deal with you. 

470
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,240
 Yet, Mr. Dundar! 

471
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,620
 Is your bravery your principality to me? 

472
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
 Who coped with the Mongolian that we will. 

473
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,340
 For the peace of the obe ... 

474
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,300
 If it is necessary to give Osman ... 

475
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,380
 Give! 

476
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,060
 I can't put out our stove for a Osman. 

477
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,300
 Bilucik right after Kulucahisar ... 

478
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,680
 The Yarhisar ... 

479
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,820
 And Inegol tekfurlar comes Commander Balgay. 

480
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,860
 I want all of these castles, Alişar. 

481
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,320
 All of their soldiers are equipped. 

482
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,560
 They strengthened the walls. 

483
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,620
 I say I want you Constantinapolis ... 

484
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,740
 You show me that the melted Byzantine walls are obstacles. 

485
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,980
 The keys to these castles ... 

486
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,580
 I have it, Balgay. 

487
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,400
 Sophia? 

488
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,360
 To protect your own land ... 

489
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,000
 It is a cheeky chick that can sell her offspring. 

490
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,320
 Now he waits for you in the castle. 

491
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,080
 How will it benefit me? 

492
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,640
 Until Constantine ... 

493
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,880
 To all markets of the Greeks ... 

494
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 Thanks to him, we will take our goods. 

495
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,220
 With our goods ... 

496
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,540
 Your soldiers will open the way. 

497
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,740
 When they wake up one morning ... 

498
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,860
 They will see their walls collapsed. 

499
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,780
 You mean Sophia? 

500
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,300
 Is it nice? 

501
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,320
 Bright as the moon ... 

502
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,440
 Shaped like milk ... 

503
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
 Poisonous like a snake. 

504
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,140
 If you carry rice the wrong way ... 

505
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,780
 On the return, you carry soil, Alişar. 

506
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,900
 Did you understand me? 

507
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,200
 I tell you ... 

508
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,420
 I'm going to carry the booty, Balgay. 

509
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,440
 As you have never seen in your life ... 

510
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,140
 A lot of booty. 

511
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,260
 Commander Balgay ... 

512
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,420
 He sent a gift to Osman Alişar Bey. 

513
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,280
 Let's see. 

514
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,080
 You are my Sheikh. 

515
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
 Everybody know your pusat. 

516
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
 They bought us one today ... 

517
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,940
 They will give a thousand tomorrow. 

518
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,220
 We will regret Mongolian to this end. 

519
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,360
 I forgot the pain of my wound from the fire of my heart. 

520
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,760
 My pain hurts as your pain hurts. 

521
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,440
 O it sons in our obba ... 

522
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,220
 We are in this cave. 

523
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,980
 Does it endure heart, sir? 

524
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,340
 Calm down. 

525
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,180
 Hz. the prophet ... 

526
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,780
 From the misconduct of the polytheists ... 

527
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,700
 He took refuge in a cave. 

528
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,940
 Remember valiant ... 

529
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
 Every truth is sheltered ... 

530
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,960
 There is a cave of sevr. 

531
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,460
 Mongolian dog ... 

532
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,640
 Until understanding the Turkish ceremony ... 

533
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,480
 No going to them from this land. 

534
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,740
 First of all, my brother Onur waits for us. 

535
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,760
 Stop, son. 

536
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,300
 When anger enters the voice ... 

537
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,380
 The mind goes all over. 

538
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,280
 Thesis should not be alive. 

539
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,940
 My Sheikh ... 

540
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,680
 Mr. Bamsı ... 

541
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,580
 I can't leave Onur in their hands. 

542
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,360
 You know the Mongolian shroud best. 

543
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,580
 These are such a snake that ... 

544
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,220
 To get you in ... 

545
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,480
 He will use Honor. 

546
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,980
 On a narrow day ... 

547
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
 Some of the jobs are crying out with the pusat ... 

548
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,160
 Some work shadow is seen in the nook. 

549
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,680
 Bala, come to Gonca with cautious clothes and rock obese ... 

550
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,560
 Our duty is there, you will be our eyes and ears. 

551
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,880
 Bamsı Bey, you take the women to the place. 

552
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
 What will I say to you? 

553
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,240
 Thank you, Osman. 

554
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,260
 It is Alişar who brought the Mongolian shroud here, sir. 

555
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,220
 This fire will burn in Alişar. 

556
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,220
 It will burn! 

557
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,240
 There was an arrow on the body, Alişar Bey. 

558
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,720
 Obviously Osman doing this job. 

559
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,220
 Deep inside every shell ... 

560
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,140
 Get rid of the flesh of each carcass 

561
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,180
 I want this land ... 

562
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,540
 I did not know who I entrusted. 

563
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
 Osman I'll bury you alive in the grave. 

564
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,060
 Swim with your hands and ... 

565
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,220
 I will feast on the ravens with your screams, Osman! 

566
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,420
 Who is this carrion? 

567
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
 The director of the New Market is Nizamettin. 

568
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,460
 What is Osman and Pazarcı doing? 

569
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,880
 Obviously Osman's intention is another Commander Balgay. 

570
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,220
 If so... 

571
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,300
 Find out what you stop. 

572
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,780
 What do you think about this, Alişar Bey? 

573
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,140
 What mind what you made him ... 

574
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,820
 Nor does the secret melt. 

575
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,280
 I tell you ... 

576
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,040
 To each tree's bark ... 

577
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,660
 Didn't I say that you will protect the shadow of every Turk? 

578
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,440
 Balgay ... 

579
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,260
 Listen to Balgay ... 

580
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,560
 What am I going to listen to, the crush of palace creation like you? 

581
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 You stealing my gold ... 

582
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,400
 You bring Kulucahisar and the apricots to the brink of war ... 

583
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,200
 Did you take care of the lands that I entrusted to you? 

584
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,960
 Balgay, listen, don't let me be your servant! 

585
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,500
 Don't be your servant! 

586
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,620
 If I could ... 

587
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,280
 Your tooth does not go into carcass of my enemy. 

588
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,340
 No way, such servant. 

589
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,520
 No! 

590
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,540
 My work in Konya ... 

591
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,980
 From sledding ... 

592
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,400
 Do not come! 

593
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,980
 Ripped stone ... 

594
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,840
 Irreplaceable Alişar! 

595
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,260
 If you want to live ... 

596
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,280
 Come to me with good news. 

597
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,820
 Don't Balgay. 

598
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,460
 Are you still here 

599
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,180
 The only benefit to me was to bring Osman. 

600
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,660
 The days when I will get your head off him are close to Alişar. 

601
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
 What was Balgay's wish for? 

602
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,200
 Did he say anything? 

603
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,280
 He has promised me Sancak Bey. 

604
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,960
 My intention is obvious. 

605
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,100
 Fear to the hearts and fear ... 

606
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,800
 He wants to collect loot. 

607
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,500
 When he thinks, he thinks he can ally me. 

608
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,360
 Since he understands that you will not be like this ... 

609
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,740
 New allies will seek. 

610
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,080
 He will do this with Alişar. 

611
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,320
 Alişar will definitely take Balgay to the castle. 

612
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
 The ranks are clear, son. 

613
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,560
 With pushes pushes ... 

614
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,340
 Wolves with wolves. 

615
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,020
 Welcome Commander Balgay. 

616
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,340
 Move away, the Byzantine shroud. 

617
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,200
 Stop! 

618
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
 Princess Sophia is waiting for you. 

619
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
 White like the moon ... 

620
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,280
 Shaped like milk ... 

621
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,780
 Are you Sophia as venomous as a snake? 

622
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,660
 The mighty Mongolian commander Balgay. 

623
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,880
 Welcome to the pen. 

624
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,940
 Alişar Bey will also come. 

625
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
 I sent Alişar to Konya. 

626
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,860
 But I didn't come empty, Princess Sophia. 

627
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,060
 How long did Nizammettin keep working on your account? 

628
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,400
 Where did you get that, Commander Balgay? 

629
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,660
 With Nizamettin, who has been at the door of Alişar for years ... 

630
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,260
 What would I do? 

631
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:39,900
 Cut! 

632
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,400
 When Osman sent this push carcass ... 

633
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,300
 Alişar, who did not have as many brains as cattle, did not know anything. 

634
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,780
 But until I solve the problem with my mind. 

635
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,320
 Akça derviş was the man of Edebalı, your biggest enemy. 

636
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,700
 To enter Alişar's daughter's bosom ... 

637
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,640
 He would suck on old man. 

638
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,480
 It is obvious that he did not. 

639
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,460
 They did not call you great commander in vain. 

640
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:38,060
 Why did you want to kill the dervish spy Sophia? 

641
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,240
 Did he see anything you hid in the mansion of Alişar? 

642
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,800
 Edebalı is our enemy as much as you. 

643
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,140
 Our common enemies ... 

644
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,140
 It will make it easier for us to deal with you. 

645
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,860
 I didn't come here to make a deal. 

646
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,540
 I came to make you my concubine. 

647
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,140
 Not me Kolucahisar ... 

648
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,700
 I let you concubine in Constantinapolis. 

649
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,100
 Balgay. 

650
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,340
 I liked you. 

651
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,940
 You are the smart woman. 

652
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,720
 You're ambitious. 

653
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,260
 You are charming, determined. 

654
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,920
 I prepared a table for you. 

655
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,900
 Here you are. 

656
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,920
 Only Byzantine cockroaches exploit on the table. 

657
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:36,940
 Putting a Mongolian on the table means putting it on the lap of your enemy. 

658
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,940
 I came here to talk business. 

659
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,160
 Or to break down your fortress. 

660
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,400
 Söğüt has four doors ... 

661
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,120
 He placed the Balgay soldier here. 

662
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
 We will leak from here. 

663
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,220
 From the back of the market. 

664
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,540
 The entry is complete, Osman Bey. 

665
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,200
 However, it will be necessary to hit while exiting. 

666
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,140
 Grasshoppers will get cold when they smell our scent. 

667
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,440
 My Boran Willow is our right. 

668
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,080
 Not Balgay, who smelled it. 

669
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,660
 It does not matter if Cengiz comes out of his grave. 

670
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,320
 The cost of crushing to Turkish is that the blood ... 

671
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,680
 First to Mongolian ... 

672
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,440
 Then we will record the whole world. 

673
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,060
 What do you want from your queen Sophia, Commander Balgay? 

674
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,340
 With Kulucahisar ... 

675
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:15,380
 You took all the beauties in your sweet language. 

676
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,860
 This castle is now mine. 

677
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,940
 Now you will give me other castles. 

678
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,900
 Since Balgay's strong hand ... 

679
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,980
 He knows where to carry me ... 

680
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,140
 The hand I perfected ... 

681
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,520
 It is my duty to serve. 

682
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,020
 Not only with my soldiers ... 

683
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,060
 We obey you with my soul in my blood, Commander Balgay. 

684
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,760
 Then I have ... 

685
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
 Turkish blood washed pusatimi ... 

686
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
 I raise my queen. 

687
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,580
 Ayse! 

688
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,300
 Enough went Zöhre's exuberance. 

689
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,600
 Dundar pattern name is its own lamb. 

690
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,740
 They determine everything from Osman. 

691
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,920
 I think my Osman is just like them ... 

692
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,280
 If they comply with Alişar, these will not happen. 

693
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,560
 My Osman did the honor, he did not crush the apricot's reputation. 

694
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,440
 What are we going to do? 

695
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,940
 If it goes like this, they will surrender Osman. 

696
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,260
 We have three days. 

697
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,760
 May Allah help us. 

698
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,100
 Are you okay, Selcan Hatun? 

699
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,020
 A state of brain obesity that is obedient to Mongolian is like that. 

700
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,760
 There is no news from my heart, my heart is a fire place. 

701
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,400
 Designing Selcan Hatun Osman is good. 

702
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,600
 Where is it like to me? 

703
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,000
 I will tell them all. 

704
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,180
 First of all, what is Ahval? 

705
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
 Balgay wants my Osman. 

706
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,900
 Dundar does not sound. 

707
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,120
 He is willing to give him what he wants. 

708
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,120
 Bala Hatun gave three days. 

709
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,040
 If Osman does not come to three days ... 

710
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,480
 He said that I will destroy the oba. 

711
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,180
 Bala, you stay. 

712
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,720
 I'll take it home. 

713
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,560
 Go now Gonca is not the time to stop. 

714
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,280
 Selcan Hatun, who was on the brink of my Osman Sheikh. 

715
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,080
 With Allah's permission, they will take root to Mongolian. 

716
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,200
 We drink martyrdom. 

717
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,900
 Or we continue our way free. 

718
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,600
 God willing. 

719
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,060
 But no one should know that I'm here. 

720
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
 Don't worry, beautiful girl. 

721
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,020
 You came or cold water spilled in my heart. 

722
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,560
 My heart is comfortable now. 

723
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
 Alişar fell out of the game. 

724
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,260
 Now the new king is Balgay. 

725
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,300
 Even a pawn ... 

726
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,220
 That the husband could overthrow the king ... 

727
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,800
 Never forget Sophia. 

728
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,940
 Checkmate. 

729
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,020
 Osman is now a living dead. 

730
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,840
 If there is no surrender ... 

731
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,340
 Balgay will destroy his oba. 

732
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,620
 He left the literary market. 

733
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,620
 Balgay will kill them when he finds them. 

734
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,900
 There is no longer even a branch of the families to hold on to. 

735
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,980
 Well ... 

736
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,620
 How do we get rid of Balgay, dad? 

737
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,260
 Everyone has a weakness, girl. 

738
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,620
 I know the weakness of Balgay best. 

739
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,140
 Where's Dad? 

740
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,160
 It's time to visit Balgay. 

741
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,200
 Thanks to you, we learned what he wanted. 

742
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,400
 You will go to give him what he wants. 

743
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,920
 God bless you, master Yannis. 

744
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,140
 Mr. Dundar ... 

745
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,100
 We have not been able to get out of trouble since I got the principality attorney. 

746
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,220
 Now the Mongols have arrived. 

747
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,200
 What do these tyrants want? 

748
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,740
 They gave three days. 

749
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,320
 Then... 

750
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,640
 They want Osman. 

751
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,700
 So many people 

752
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,200
 For a Osman? 

753
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,360
 Let's get rid of. 

754
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,580
 Do you give millet from the shed sheep warehouse? 

755
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,540
 Osman is entrusted to me by my father. 

756
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,480
 What about our children? 

757
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,900
 Who are they entrusted to? 

758
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,820
 Mr. income comes ... 

759
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,940
 Take care of her oba. 

760
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
 Not Osman ... 

761
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,520
 I wouldn't even give an icicle from the brick of this obala 

762
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,520
 Will we sacrifice the oba for Osman? 

763
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,080
 The issue is not Osman! 

764
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,600
 It's about freedom. 

765
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,620
 Don't you still understand? 

766
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:16,440
 You can understand, Mr. Gündüz! 

767
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,460
 With the driven freedom ... 

768
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,680
 Honeys are not saturated with dry words. 

769
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,680
 Since when ... 

770
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,620
 Companion to the enemy was the way? 

771
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,520
 We are apricot! 

772
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,440
 We call these mountains liberty ... 

773
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
 They also give us Allahu akbar. 

774
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,640
 What is this frustration without blood! 

775
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,500
 Enough! 

776
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,940
 Such toy ... 

777
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,980
 No such consultation. 

778
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,260
 Come to yourself! 

779
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,640
 Isn't there a gentleman in this council that you act like a gentleman? 

780
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,340
 Sit down! 

781
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,580
 Not sitting ... 

782
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,280
 It's time for honor, Dundar Bey. 

783
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,560
 Let us know the judgment as well. 

784
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,820
 Provision... 

785
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,700
 It is as clear as the horny of Mongolian. 

786
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,840
 Oguz breathing ... 

787
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,380
 Prophet's ceremony ... 

788
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,360
 They say there is violence together. 

789
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,700
 Without falling into conflict ... 

790
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,820
 We will wait for Osman. 

791
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,760
 What if Dundar Bey does not come? 

792
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,000
 Joyful... 

793
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,720
 You think about your children ... 

794
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:31,780
 We are our children ... 

795
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,920
 We know Demirci. 

796
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,480
 Osman is crazy ... 

797
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,640
 But it's full ... 

798
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,540
 It is sick. 

799
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,120
 He does not leave his obes alone. 

800
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,100
 When you hear ... 

801
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,800
 Even in the end, 

802
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,960
 It gets up. 

803
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,060
 Old dude ... 

804
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,380
 Did he come? 

805
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,100
 He'll be here soon, sir. 

806
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,820
 Yannis from Madrid. 

807
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,580
 Years have passed over ... 

808
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,780
 Look, we met again. 

809
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,140
 I came to finish our unfinished business. 

810
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,300
 Sheikh Edebalı ... 

811
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,200
 Ahi universe ... 

812
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,980
 How we killed together ... 

813
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,700
 We will kill him too. 

814
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,960
 What did you bring to me, Yannis? 

815
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,540
 What are these names? 

816
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,800
 Who are they? 

817
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,760
 Bilecik, İnegök, ... 

818
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,640
 Harmankaya. 

819
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,620
 The names of my monks connected to me in all the castles. 

820
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,020
 Some castle commander ... 

821
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
 Some soldiers ... 

822
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,000
 Some doctor ... 

823
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,260
 The cook is more ... 

824
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,600
 All with an order of mine ... 

825
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,420
 Ready to serve you. 

826
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:10,180
 Why would you do this, Yannis? 

827
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,200
 For my daughter. 

828
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,780
 Is she your daughter? 

829
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,820
 Sophie. 

830
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,020
 You are beautiful here ... 

831
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,680
 With a queen ... 

832
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,920
 I came to give Constantinepolis, Balgay. 

833
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,160
 Our ancestors say ... 

834
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,280
 Listen to the old word ... 

835
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,760
 Eat cooked food too. 

836
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:53,260
 If I don't like the food you serve with your daughter ... 

837
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,900
 You'll drown when I vomit Yannis. 

838
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,300
 Don't forget this. 

839
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,800
 To Grand Genghis Khan ... 

840
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,100
 And to his offspring. 

841
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,720
 They keep Onur in the church ... 

842
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,840
 My mister should take precautionary measures. 

843
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,800
 You wait here, I will take Onur and leave. 

844
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,440
 However, when we go out, we must hit. 

845
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,740
 Let's be careful, brothers. 

846
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,140
 Thank you, Samsa Bey. 

847
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:57,340
 What are you looking for, Osman Bey? 

848
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,780
 Download pusats. 

849
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,720
 Osman Bey had ambushed. 

850
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,420
 Osman Bey, be careful. 

851
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,180
 I will drown you all in your blood. 

852
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
 As many as you ... 

853
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,420
 He was in love with our pushes. 

854
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,060
 Come here. 

855
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,360
 You came to the end of the road, Balgay. 

856
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
 Come and fight. 

857
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:30,820
 Do you know what happens to the dog who is eager for salvation? 

858
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,360
 Among other dogs ... 

859
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,660
 It is to be understood ... 

860
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:46,920
 May it be a lesson. 

861
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,840
 Commander Balgay ... 

862
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,960
 Osman fled. 

863
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:13,020
 But we captured their alps. 

864
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,940
 He will come back for his dog. 

865
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,800
 This time we will go. 

866
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,780
 We will give a blood feast in the Kayi oba. 

867
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,740
 Across the might ... 

868
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
 They will learn to surrender. 

869
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,600
 What did they do to you, Onur brother? 

870
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,900
 They converted their title to Söğüt market. 

871
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,640
 Look at him. 

872
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,640
 What did they do to me? 

873
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,180
 I'm like a lion. 

874
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,940
 Aslan ... 

875
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,240
 Wounded lion. 

876
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,240
 Don't touch me, Samsa Sergeant. 

877
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,140
 It's like a lion, my brother. 

878
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,000
 Snow is great if it snows, and stone is howling it is. 

879
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,360
 Not me... 

880
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,300
 The great one is there. 

881
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,820
 My brother... 

882
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,640
 Nemrutlar, pharaohs, abdomen ... 

883
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,700
 Not with Cüsse ... 

884
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,840
 What it is to rebel with your heart ... 

885
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,440
 He showed us again. 

886
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,800
 My lion. 

887
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,600
 No, Apturrahman Gazim. 

888
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,880
 You dived deeper again. 

889
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,400
 We have persistence in the war, ribat at the end ... 

890
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,200
 On the road to gas like you ... 

891
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:45,660
 We have determined from the veteran valiant, whose beard was heavy. 

892
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,240
 I dived or stayed. 

893
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:51,860
 A brave man like Osman Bey because of us ... 

894
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,800
 I worry about being captured. 

895
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:57,060
 Get comfortable for Apturrahman Gazi. 

896
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,560
 Amine. 

897
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,440
 What will we do now, Samsa Bey? 

898
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,940
 Don't worry. 

899
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,560
 By the alpine ceremony ... 

900
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,500
 Have we not decided to use a sword? 

901
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,040
 Didn't we say we won't get tired or fall apart? 

902
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:27,540
 to plunder ... 

903
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,880
 To poisonous snakes ... 

904
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,980
 Didn't we swear that we would never surrender? 

905
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,420
 He Honor brother? 

906
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:36,100
 He Boran brother? 

907
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,360
 We did, we did. 

908
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,920
 We've got Samsa Sergeant. 

909
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,480
 Let there be cruel people, let their cruelty be upon us. 

910
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,060
 You have a nightmare like a nightmare ... 

911
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,480
 Kavli our ... 

912
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,820
 Our decision ... 

913
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,240
 Our promise is also one. 

914
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,320
 Whatever fate is, let it come. 

915
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,100
 Let the martyrdom be written to dengü stone. 

916
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,600
 Allahu akbar. 

917
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:35,180
 Yarenler ... 

918
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,740
 Now listen to me. 

919
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,740
 Gonca chick ... 

920
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,560
 You say ... 

921
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,540
 What is the quarrel of the oban? 

922
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,200
 Osman Bey is bad 

923
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:01,460
 Mongolian wants you. 

924
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:07,160
 Dündar bey has bowed. 

925
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,880
 If you do not surrender in three days ... 

926
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,320
 I lost everything my thing. 

927
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,780
 All parts of Söğüt were occupied. 

928
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,220
 All the plaques were raided. 

929
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,380
 All gentlemen were taken prisoner. 

930
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:08,980
 Osman! 

931
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,320
 My Alps are also in your hands. 

932
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,440
 Osman get up! 

933
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:41,460
 From the century's happiness ... 

934
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,140
 Our Lord ... 

935
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,980
 Let me give you a ride from the war in Uhut ... 

936
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,640
 Understand what the load is. 

937
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,220
 That day... 

938
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:55,880
 When they face the enemy ... 

939
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,040
 Where two world suns live ... 

940
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,880
 Do you think it's easy? 

941
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,500
 Exactly 300 warriors ... 

942
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,480
 He let him down. 

943
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,760
 He was injured by pusat on the cheek. 

944
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,060
 Stone and lip were shattered. 

945
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,760
 The female was broken. 

946
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,280
 After the sword hit ... 

947
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,780
 Blood leaked from the blessed forehead. 

948
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,280
 On his way back to Mecca ... 

949
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:27,620
 He fell into one of the pits of the polytheists ... 

950
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:29,500
 The drama was broken. 

951
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,640
 Nice comrade ... 

952
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,000
 Even... 

953
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:36,460
 God's Lion... 

954
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:39,760
 His uncle Hz. Hamza ... 

955
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,460
 He lost in war. 

956
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,880
 Even in this case ... 

957
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,340
 O my Lord, have mercy. 

958
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,920
 He said they don't know the truth. 

959
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,300
 You know why all this happened? 

960
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:59,760
 Because... 

961
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:02,620
 The commandments of our Prophet ... 

962
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,600
 The deficiency was fulfilled. 

963
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,540
 At the beginning of Cenk ... 

964
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,880
 Believers who see the shroud escaping ... 

965
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,200
 Archers leave their hill and ... 

966
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,320
 He ran after the booty. 

967
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:21,140
 Remember, son ... 

968
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,240
 The ancient history of Islam ... 

969
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,360
 It is his greatest teaching. 

970
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,240
 When the believers break up ... 

971
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,820
 The polytheists rise up. 

972
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,480
 Now it's up to you ... 

973
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,580
 Not to disperse ... 

974
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:48,120
 It is to gather and recover. 

975
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,220
 Kayı obasi ... 

976
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,680
 At the end of Bitinya ... 

977
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:57,660
 The believers are the archers' hill, son. 

978
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,900
 If we leave there ... 

979
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,960
 The polytheists will perform their persecution by folding. 

980
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,240
 Now... 

981
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,680
 To me... 

982
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,260
 Otag to ... 

983
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,700
 Claim your case. 

984
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:16,580
 Come out, believers are rising ... 

985
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,360
 The polytheists get poison. 

986
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:30,120
 I fell into heedlessness, Sheikh. 

987
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:44,740
 Gonca Hatun ... 

988
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,200
 Now listen to what I have to say ... 

989
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,520
 Go to Obaya Selcan aunt. 

990
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,960
 Stand up, lions! 

991
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,040
 Do not please the enemy, stand upright! 

992
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:32,420
 Now we will teach obedience to dogs! 

993
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,500
 Those who do not persecute will bow to the cruel. 

994
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:54,780
 Come on brothers! 

995
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,800
 To you... 

996
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,900
 I brought the estal. 

997
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,420
 God, give us strength. 

998
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:52,740
 You obviously forgot. 

999
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:00,000
 The head that does not lean in front of Mongolian ... 

1000
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,780
 Cut! 

1001
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
 (How do I get out of this business) 

1002
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,320
 (Give me the power to beat my enemy) 

1003
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,680
 (Help my brothers) 

1004
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,660
 What are you doing, Sıddık? 

1005
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,760
 I said your exam will be tough. 

1006
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:22,920
 Are you ready? 

1007
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,480
 What do you say, Osman Bey. 

1008
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,880
 You will betray me. 

1009
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,480
 You follow me in sequence ... 

1010
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,920
 Who are you ? 

1011
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:39,220
 You will learn Osman Bey. 

1012
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:56,020
 The crescent moon that shines today will shine in your sign, Osman Bey. 

1013
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,180
 Your time has come. 

1014
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,400
 Dundar ... 

1015
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,500
 Oh Dundar ... 

1016
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,540
 Fastness of his obo .. 

1017
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
 Dundar is silent while being persecuted. 

1018
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:40,920
 They were a pity to the trust of my Ertuğrul Bey. 

1019
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:53,060
 Mr. Bamsı, this persecution does not stop! 

1020
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,820
 What do you do? Bamsı Bey will call you everywhere. 

1021
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,440
 I will live with this shame ... 

1022
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,040
 I die a thousand times Selcan Hatun! 

1023
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,720
 Thank goodness we haven't died yet. 

1024
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:06,820
 Follow me. 

1025
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,020
 Gonca Hatun ... 

1026
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,880
 Is Bala Hatun ready? 

1027
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,980
 Osman Bey did not leave his alps at the mercy of Balgay. 

1028
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:05,260
 Ertuğrul Bey's trust is in safe hands Bamsı Bey. 

1029
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,040
 We will not give up. 

1030
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,820
 Who are you? 

1031
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,320
 What would you like from me? 

1032
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:20,200
 The answers are not in us, but Osman Bey. 

1033
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:31,320
 Come in if you're ready. 

1034
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,120
 This rabid pus ... 

1035
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
 Did you break my leg, Dundar! 

1036
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,800
 Stay back! 

1037
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,980
 Stand back, don't fall under my feet like an insect. 

1038
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,880
 The persecution you have made ... 

1039
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:28,460
 You will drown with the blood you have shed. 

1040
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:46,180
 Judging by his stickiness ... 

1041
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,520
 You're a babe. 

1042
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,540
 Not that... 

1043
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:53,200
 You don't know me. 

1044
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,780
 Mongolian's iron fist ... 

1045
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,920
 They call me Balgay. 

1046
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:02,340
 I make lakes of blood ... 

1047
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,040
 Mountains out of bone. 

1048
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:06,060
 In the land I traveled ... 

1049
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:08,220
 The fire rises. 

1050
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,680
 It... 

1051
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:12,880
 Heavenly quarters ... 

1052
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,920
 Balgay has been a grave for many bloody cruelties. 

1053
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:20,420
 It will happen to you too. 

1054
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,840
 His passion in ambition ... 

1055
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:27,780
 Blowers. 

1056
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:31,080
 Sky-eyed boy. 

1057
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,180
 You... 

1058
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:44,700
 For the sign of worship ... 

1059
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,120
 I will slowly kill. 

1060
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:44,620
 Barreled apricot ... 

1061
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,500
 Samsa Sergeant. 

1062
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,240
 Shoo! 

1063
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:56,620
 You will be like a dog. 

1064
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,700
 The famous baby of Ertuğrul ... 

1065
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:25,700
 Aptuhrahman Gazi. 

1066
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:47,680
 Heads that do not bow to the might of Mongolian ... 

1067
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:50,580
 You will all watch what happens to you! 

1068
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:13,200
 Let me go. 

1069
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,320
 Leave my son. 

1070
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,200
 As much as your privates ... 

1071
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,880
 Your babies are brave too courageous. 

1072
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:35,220
 In the Balgay Eurasian ... 

1073
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:37,020
 He loves his heart at the time. 

1074
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,300
 These avras ... 

1075
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,580
 Is he as much as they are hearted? 

1076
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,580
 Let's see. 

1077
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:08,380
 Bring me and my soldiers. 

1078
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,100
 You... 

1079
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,600
 I die and I do not serve. 

1080
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,260
 Then... 

1081
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,160
 Instead of who ... 

1082
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:23,400
 Watch me drink the blood of this boy. 

1083
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:28,800
 No! 

1084
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:41,740
 I will bring! 

1085
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,060
 Lets! 

1086
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:53,580
 Aunt... 

1087
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:56,920
 Right. 

1088
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:05,940
 Aunt. 

1089
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:53,320
 Who are you? 

1090
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:55,620
 We... 

1091
02:04:57,080 --> 02:05:00,300
 We are the roots of the great plane tree called Osman, Osman. 

1092
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:06,340
 We got stuck in Ergenekon ... 

1093
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:11,120
 In Malazgirt, we burned the world by firing. 

1094
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,880
 Now ... 

1095
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:16,420
 From Ötüken to Söğüt ... 

1096
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:18,980
 We came to make a happy way. 

1097
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:22,100
 What have I seen you up to this time ... 

1098
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:23,840
 Neither did I hear. 

1099
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,520
 The Shawshank ... 

1100
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,800
 We appear in the dark. 

1101
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:33,380
 With the light of our ancestor Oğuz ... 

1102
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,520
 We came to light her way. 

1103
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:39,200
 Your father is Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

1104
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,800
 Your grandfather, Süleyman Şah ... 

1105
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:44,640
 It is included in our people. 

1106
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,540
 Now... 

1107
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:50,820
 The tip of our nesting crescents ... 

1108
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,960
 He points to you. 

1109
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,820
 The last state of the Turk ... 

1110
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,160
 Seljuk ... 

1111
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:46,960
 It became tarumar with the Mongol invasion. 

1112
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:49,140
 Not that... 

1113
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:52,460
 Hopelessness is not at our ceremony. 

1114
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,920
 At the end we hold on to the ceremony ... 

1115
02:07:58,100 --> 02:07:59,340
 Ahval is bad. 

1116
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:03,560
 We do not serve the servant. 

1117
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,060
 We don't obey anyone. 

1118
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:08,160
 Not that... 

1119
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,280
 The persecution has surrounded all sides. 

1120
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:19,080
 Hope the people are about to run out. 

1121
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:21,420
 Unlike... 

1122
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:25,100
 The hope of the Turk is at the extreme. 

1123
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
 Your father Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

1124
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:34,160
 The will that sent it to this end ... 

1125
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,740
 This is hope. 

1126
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:39,740
 Unless the sky collapses on top ... 

1127
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:44,380
 Unless the place is drilled at the bottom ... 

1128
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:47,800
 Every Turkish is a state. 

1129
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:53,560
 Because, even if the province is gone, it is a custom. 

1130
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:56,320
 Thank you. 

1131
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:59,120
 Thank you but ... 

1132
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:01,540
 Balgay occupied everywhere. 

1133
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,560
 In Turkish oba ... 

1134
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,980
 Victory cries of the Mongols rise. 

1135
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,080
 We are here for that. 

1136
02:09:10,580 --> 02:09:11,940
 Grief ... 

1137
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:15,260
 Let your heart bury you in the ground of hope. 

1138
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:19,120
 And remember, Osman Bey ... 

1139
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:22,340
 Turkish ageless ... 

1140
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:25,700
 Turkish independence ... 

1141
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:27,960
 Turkish stateless ... 

1142
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,360
 No way! 

1143
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,300
 The power to stop Balgay ... 

1144
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:52,860
 It is inside the chest. 

1145
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:02,920
 Balgay loved you. 

1146
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,140
 Inner. 

1147
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:23,260
 Inner. 

1148
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:40,880
 Inner. 

1149
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:42,820
 Inner. 

1150
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:46,800
 Or I'll make you drink the boy's blood.

1
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,220
 Genghis Khan's law says ... 

2
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,620
 In the enemy land ... 

3
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,580
 If they give you a treat ... 

4
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,940
 Drink it to the one who brought it first. 

5
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
 You will surely drink the sherbet of death. 

6
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
 Aunt! 

7
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 No, do not do it! 

8
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
 Now the suffering persecuted! 

9
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,380
 What happens on land cannot come before me ... 

10
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,480
 He cannot climb to the slope with his nail. 

11
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,080
 What do you think you are ... 

12
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,460
 Sky-eyed nail. 

13
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
 Let Selcan Hatun go. 

14
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,820
 You're going to kill! 

15
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
 Valiant, dear ... 

16
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,260
 The job has fallen ... 

17
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,660
 Now your words are pusat. 

18
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
 Will we wait for Osman Bey? 

19
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,760
 My beautiful son, we wait, but ... 

20
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
 The opponent does not wait. 

21
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
 Alone... 

22
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,000
 Bala Hatun ... 

23
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
 Gonca Hatun ... 

24
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
 This will be a strange war ... 

25
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,640
 Let us know about Sheikh Edebalı. 

26
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
 You should tell her ... 

27
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,160
 If Kayi's privates remain, then the veteran ... 

28
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
 If they stout, they will be martyred. 

29
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,940
 You should not spare this from us. 

30
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,180
 Here you go. 

31
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
 With my compassion ... 

32
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,300
 I broke your eyes ... 

33
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
 You can see what you put on my daughter. 

34
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,920
 Enough! 

35
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
 Is it enough for one line of power ... 

36
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,480
 Pedigree dog. 

37
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,500
 Balgay! 

38
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,180
 Do you understand if I say enough? 

39
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,360
 Father! 

40
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,380
 My day, my God, help us. 

41
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,960
 Leave my father ... 

42
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,240
 Father! 

43
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540
 Shepherd's head ... 

44
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,800
 If you go too, who will drive the goats? 

45
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,580
 What happens? 

46
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,100
 It is the day of giving the Ahis back to back with those who are not. 

47
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,860
 Tell me everything I have with my father. 

48
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,400
 Joyful? 

49
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
 The fires of those worlds are extinguished during the harming. 

50
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,840
 I will stay here. 

51
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,380
 May you be entrusted to Allah. 

52
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,600
 You too, Gonca. 

53
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
 Honorable enemies ... 

54
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,340
 It shouldn't die like an insect. 

55
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,960
 Osman... 

56
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,480
 Pedigree of ... 

57
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
 Oguz said that he was based on Han ... 

58
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,940
 Han nobles in the Mongolian ceremony ... 

59
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,660
 It is wrapped in goats and chewed on horse ... 

60
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
 Don't let their blood fall into the ground. 

61
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
 Jinx counts. 

62
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
 Take them to the others. 

63
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
 Son! 

64
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,380
 Leave! 

65
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 I will also cut their wings. 

66
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,640
 Shepherd head Dundar also ... 

67
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,000
 To watch. 

68
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,240
 Now... 

69
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,240
 What happened to those who did not obey Mongolian ... 

70
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 You will all see. 

71
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,820
 Let me die for my Lord. 

72
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,460
 Let me die with my own honor. 

73
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
 Mr. Gündüz! 

74
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,340
 Balgay is now the persecution you've had! 

75
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 Come on, kids! 

76
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,780
 Souls! 

77
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,720
 Time... 

78
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
 It is the time of martyrdom. 

79
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,540
 Time... 

80
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,840
 It is time to kiyama. 

81
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
 Allahu akbar. 

82
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,680
 Tell them to their alps. 

83
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,040
 Hold on to pusat. 

84
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
 Do we have a dumb demon in our ceremony? 

85
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,540
 It is time for martyrdom! 

86
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,220
 Allahu akbar! 

87
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,240
 My Osman was enough. 

88
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
 My Lord will not be asking for wisdom ... 

89
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,980
 Thank goodness for you. 

90
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,720
 Balgay ... 

91
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
 To Balgay's hell ... 

92
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
 Welcome Osman. 

93
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
 I came to clean the Turkish oba. 

94
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
 You and your soldiers ... 

95
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
 You say stop the persecution. 

96
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,860
 Looking at you ... 

97
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
 You know what I can see? 

98
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
 Chopped with my pusat ... 

99
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,400
 A carcass dedicated to ravens. 

100
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,520
 You see yourself in the mirror, Balgay. 

101
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,580
 I offered you Sancak Bey. 

102
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,600
 You refused. 

103
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 I said I'll give you death ... 

104
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,540
 The word comes out of Balgay's mouth once. 

105
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,740
 I do not go back on my word, Osman Bey. 

106
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,780
 You're a dead man now. 

107
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
 Not to serve you here ... 

108
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,300
 I came to give the power of Genghis Khan. 

109
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,540
 Genghis Khan's name ... 

110
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
 Let your heart tremble. 

111
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,540
 What might you talk about? 

112
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,940
 Now what are you listening to me ... 

113
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
 Or you darken it. 

114
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,520
 I have a treasure that no Mongolian commander can refuse. 

115
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
 Genghis Khan's might ... 

116
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,100
 As my noble wanders in my blood ... 

117
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
 What travels in your language? 

118
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,520
 Genghis Khan says ... 

119
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,860
 With her consent ... 

120
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,180
 Listen to your enemy with courage. 

121
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,660
 Listen ... 

122
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,280
 Let the valiant show you have the power to respond with bravery. 

123
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,640
 Or... 

124
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
 Don't you dare, Balgay? 

125
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,460
 Commander Balgay ... 

126
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
 Messengers came from Konya. 

127
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
 These are the messengers sent by Geyhatu. 

128
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
 We brought news from Geyhatu, Balgay. 

129
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,420
 Geyhatu wants you. 

130
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,100
 He asks me to send you and your alps to Konya. 

131
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
 How does Koca Geyhatu know you? 

132
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
 What are you up to, Osman? 

133
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,320
 Geyhatu appreciates my treasure. 

134
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
 How long have I been waiting for him to come and pick me up? 

135
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,120
 What is this treasure? 

136
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
 What do you do, Osman? 

137
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,340
 Shut up, shut up! 

138
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,260
 Osman did not come empty. 

139
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,400
 Soldiers lower your pusets. 

140
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
 Tonga, Cankutay ... 

141
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,640
 Stop executions. 

142
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,760
 Captive prisoners is the command of Geyhatu. 

143
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Let go now ... 

144
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,080
 Osman ruined all our plans. 

145
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
 He spent Alişay on Balgay. 

146
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,260
 He killed Nizamettin. 

147
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,500
 Now Balgay. 

148
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,740
 Mongolians. 

149
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,460
 With scent smells. 

150
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
 They came with their greed. 

151
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,360
 Mongolian fire ... 

152
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,760
 It also heats from a distance to the heating ... 

153
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
 If you get closer it burns ... 

154
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,920
 Ashes my daughter. 

155
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,280
 Damn it. 

156
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,980
 We have no hope other than the steppe bear called Balgay. 

157
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,980
 I had to kiss that dirty hand. 

158
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
 As I think, I feel sick. 

159
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
 Balgay is a total trouble ... 

160
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,820
 A creature that does not listen, does not listen. 

161
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 But it's not our last hope. 

162
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 There may be another way of salvation. 

163
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,920
 Salvador. 

164
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 Can we trust Salvador, sir? 

165
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,180
 Can play binary. 

166
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,080
 We can't know without trying Sophia. 

167
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,560
 We will try, both Salvador ... 

168
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 Both the Mongols. 

169
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
 The best person knows ... 

170
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
 The crime partner is the princess. 

171
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
 I know the Mongols. 

172
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,780
 We will present them Constantinepolis. 

173
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
 They are strong enough to take if they want. 

174
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,940
 Thus... 

175
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 You become the queen. 

176
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 And one day you take a look ... 

177
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
 Your Mongolian husband is dead. 

178
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
 Come with me, Osman Bey. 

179
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,940
 Let's talk inside. 

180
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
 Come in, Dundar Bey. 

181
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,840
 How about you Osman? 

182
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
 What is Genghis Khan's might? 

183
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,060
 This push is sure to let nobody shed their blood anymore. 

184
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,740
 Trust me. 

185
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
 Respect Turkish against Balgay. 

186
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,920
 I would like to know what he will say. 

187
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
 I didn't come here for nothing, Balgay. 

188
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,720
 Watch out for those who come out of your mouth. 

189
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,420
 Cut it off. 

190
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,140
 I listen to you, talk. 

191
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 I do not take orders from Mongolian. 

192
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,440
 Emmi ... 

193
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,320
 Is there a destruction? 

194
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,740
 You're up, son. 

195
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,040
 This is the dagger I hold in my hand ... 

196
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,680
 In your hand... 

197
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,060
 The dagger protecting the laws of Genghis Khan ... 

198
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,140
 You're out of mind. 

199
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,880
 My wife was blowing like a wind and he breathed Balgay. 

200
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,700
 Once upon a time... 

201
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,220
 I was captured in their hands ... 

202
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,080
 My Ertuğrul Bey ... 

203
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,860
 He came to my rescue like Hızır. 

204
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,620
 Siblings... 

205
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
 To them this land ... 

206
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,480
 We will narrow. 

207
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,460
 This time the situation is not the same valiant. 

208
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,380
 These eyes saw many Mongols. 

209
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,700
 But Balgay ... 

210
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
 Different from all of them ... 

211
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 All geared ... 

212
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,020
 You too, to narrow this land to him ... 

213
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
 To beat him ... 

214
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
 You must install various games. 

215
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,980
 Let's get out of here ... 

216
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,420
 That Samsa Bey ... 

217
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,060
 Hunt this Mongolian shroud like a partridge ... 

218
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,900
 If he does not bury him alive, let him be holy. 

219
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,120
 Where did you find this? 

220
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,900
 Commander Balgay ... 

221
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
 Osman lies. 

222
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,820
 The happy dagger of Genghis Khan cannot be in the hands of a Turk. 

223
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,180
 Balgay ... 

224
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
 You didn't train your soldiers well ... 

225
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,220
 They decide before you. 

226
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,180
 If the... 

227
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,960
 If all your army is like this ... 

228
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
 Constantine dreams. 

229
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,000
 He wrote ... 

230
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
 The laws of Genghis Khan are in my hands. 

231
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,980
 Great Genghis Khan's ... 

232
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
 Lost laws in your hands? 

233
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
 Can you hear what you say? 

234
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,400
 Where is it? 

235
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,860
 Give it to me immediately. 

236
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
 First fulfill my conditions. 

237
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,600
 Say it now. 

238
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,600
 You will release my Alps. 

239
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
 You will take my obese and leave it. 

240
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
 You will return the treasures you took from us. 

241
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,360
 I set this up toy ... 

242
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,740
 You will certify by promising in front of the gentlemen. 

243
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,760
 I'm here ... 

244
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,580
 I came to take the lives of those who rebelled against me. 

245
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 If what you say is a lie ... 

246
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,420
 Today... 

247
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
 With all my army ... 

248
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
 I wash the kayı obası. 

249
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,080
 Know it. 

250
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,040
 Distribution scale load ... 

251
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,860
 Let's break bondage chains. 

252
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
 Open the shutter doors. 

253
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,760
 I Uthman ... 

254
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
 You cannot trust Balgay's judgment ... 

255
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
 It is necessary to be vigilant. 

256
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
 Balgay cannot beat Osman Bey either. 

257
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,220
 Shortly afterwards, the crows sing for war 

258
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
 This time, the fire to burn is big, sir. 

259
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,220
 If hell came ... 

260
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
 We put out our chest, evelallah. 

261
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,220
 As long as we believe. 

262
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,420
 I'll put it out, of course, my beautiful son. 

263
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,420
 Of course we will extinguish. 

264
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
 The heavenly trust you brought ... 

265
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
 His great ethics ... 

266
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 Atam Cengiz's in the skies ... 

267
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,540
 He brought it closer to his soul. 

268
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,540
 You said gentlemen ... 

269
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,760
 They are here now. 

270
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,740
 What will you say. 

271
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,340
 To us... 

272
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,040
 With Oba Töre ... 

273
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,060
 Töre plays with toy. 

274
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,880
 Not that... 

275
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,620
 Toy doesn't start like this. 

276
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,900
 When you say be ... 

277
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,740
 Filling our hearts with the light of faith ... 

278
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,400
 With the 99 names of Allah. 

279
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,500
 Valiant gentlemen of Kayı ... 

280
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,160
 In my hand... 

281
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
 Balgay also valued very much ... 

282
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,200
 There are Genghis laws. 

283
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,640
 These laws are very important for a Mongolian commander. 

284
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
 Because to capture these treasures ... 

285
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
 Mongols have been tracing for so many years. 

286
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,340
 Now they are in my hands. 

287
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
 In return for bringing those laws ... 

288
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
 Balgay will leave the oba. 

289
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,220
 It will release our Alps. 

290
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,520
 I wanted ... 

291
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,340
 In the presence of Toyun ... 

292
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
 May your peace be promised. 

293
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
 Thank you. 

294
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,400
 Atam Cengiz ... 

295
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
 While alone ... 

296
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,600
 When not, pay attention to your word. 

297
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,040
 He had commanded. 

298
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,520
 I'm Balgay. 

299
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,000
 I made this promise. 

300
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,600
 If Osman keeps his word in ... 

301
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,400
 I swear you will do what you say. 

302
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,460
 If there is a game in the game ... 

303
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,980
 You know ... 

304
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,660
 Push your ... 

305
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,020
 I even put your sheep on fire. 

306
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,500
 In the cradle ... 

307
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,600
 I don't even put your baby alive. 

308
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,260
 Then... 

309
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,420
 It is up to me to keep my word. 

310
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,800
 Sir... 

311
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,280
 Osman is dangerous ... 

312
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,080
 Even if it is crowded around ... 

313
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
 He is like a lone wolf. 

314
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,240
 It is true that he is alone. 

315
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,020
 All the alps are in the hands of the Mongols. 

316
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
 Just like my soldiers ... 

317
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,660
 As in his hands. 

318
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,080
 Let me go and find out what he's doing. 

319
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,560
 You may be lying. 

320
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,640
 You may be fighting against us again with Osman. 

321
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,400
 Salvador... 

322
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,220
 Man may be getting rid of death many times. 

323
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,260
 But no one can escape forever. 

324
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
 Do you understand me? 

325
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,600
 Yes sir. 

326
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,340
 Trust me... 

327
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,260
 I will serve you a lot in this war. 

328
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
 Leave Osman on the palm of your hand ... 

329
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,060
 I swore not to die without forgiving myself. 

330
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
 If you make a mistake ... 

331
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,140
 I swim deeply alive. 

332
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,280
 I Uthman ... 

333
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,860
 I Uthman ... 

334
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,800
 What did he say Balgay shroud? 

335
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
 I am Bamsı Bey who will keep his word. 

336
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,740
 Do not worry. 

337
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,420
 He will leave our obesity. 

338
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,420
 It will release the Alps. 

339
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,460
 This is good Osman. 

340
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,440
 Where did Genghis Khan law come from? 

341
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
 Who gave it to you, Osman? 

342
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,820
 My secret is Bamsı Bey. 

343
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,760
 I can't say beyond. 

344
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,740
 Son. 

345
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,560
 Does the comrade hide the road from the comrade? 

346
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,660
 There are ways that comrade also cannot go, Bamsı Bey. 

347
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,460
 I Uthman ... 

348
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,440
 There was no way we came to this land ... 

349
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,600
 We opened the roads we entered with our blood and soul. 

350
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,680
 Osman, this situation will overwhelm me. 

351
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,660
 What is this job for me? 

352
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,260
 Don't come on me, Bamsı Bey. 

353
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,080
 Osman! 

354
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
 Don't be assumed by Bamsı Bey. 

355
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,040
 I can't say beyond. 

356
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,040
 We did not see such comradeship. 

357
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,960
 Either the way we walk is not a road ... 

358
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
 Or we can tell you ... 

359
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
 We couldn't record it. 

360
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
 Geyhatu's laws of Genghis Khan ... 

361
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,700
 The reason for asking Osman is obvious Balgay. 

362
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,860
 Who is the law ... 

363
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
 The power is in Cerkutay. 

364
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,280
 Nobody can stand before him. 

365
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
 If Osman brings the laws ... 

366
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
 In this land power ... 

367
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,820
 You will be in power. 

368
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,060
 Matter... 

369
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,020
 It's not that I get it ... 

370
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,920
 Osman... 

371
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,160
 This dagger protecting the laws of Grand Genghis Khan ... 

372
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,820
 How did he find it? 

373
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
 How can Geyhatu know this? 

374
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,720
 Osman ... 

375
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,520
 I didn't act as to where you found it ... 

376
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
 You think I swear. 

377
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,240
 Prior to... 

378
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,280
 Let me take the power in one hand. 

379
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,400
 I will learn his fate when the time comes. 

380
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,940
 If Osman brings the laws ... 

381
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,660
 Will you give it to Geyhatu? 

382
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,320
 If he can afford ... 

383
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
 Income takes its own. 

384
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,580
 To the Mongolian khanate ... 

385
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
 I will take him personally. 

386
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,280
 Balgay is now ... 

387
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,540
 He will come to the position he deserves in Mongolian khanate. 

388
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,960
 What is the situation? 

389
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,860
 Balgay swallowed the bait. 

390
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,160
 Beyond me. 

391
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,480
 Then... 

392
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,380
 Come on, Osman. 

393
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,380
 Dem is also your transfer. 

394
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
 Then next to the mountains ... 

395
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,380
 Let the ages go by. 

396
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
 For Osman in Destiny ... 

397
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,440
 He was praying. 

398
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,380
 O gone, Zöhre. 

399
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
 For the sake of his son ... 

400
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,780
 You hope to have a headscarf from Osman. 

401
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,700
 From anyone ... 

402
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,900
 We do not have any hope, Medet. 

403
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,940
 You think I'm going to feed my Batur to that Balgay dog. 

404
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
 If necessary, I will throw myself in front of you ... 

405
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,300
 I don't make my son eat it. 

406
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,240
 Let your ear hear from your mouth ... 

407
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,880
 Don't make me crazy! 

408
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
 I am worried about my child, Dundar Bey. 

409
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,540
 Hopefully Osman will find a solution. 

410
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,820
 But if he finds ... 

411
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
 Then leave me ... 

412
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
 All the oba will bear him. 

413
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,380
 You will be spoken to me ... 

414
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
 Think about what you will come with that day. 

415
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,420
 In the obesity of Kayı ... 

416
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
 I'll say the last word. 

417
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,180
 Osman knows this very well. 

418
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,940
 Osman has made a knot ... 

419
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,220
 Elbet will solve it himself. 

420
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
 Toy, beylik ... 

421
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,400
 It is not a Bala job. 

422
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,420
 It's not that tall. 

423
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
 They tortured you so much. 

424
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,160
 They. 

425
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
 They did it, but it was worth Osman Bey. 

426
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,680
 Is it easy to be both Sidik? 

427
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,880
 You say ... 

428
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,320
 What is the situation? 

429
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
 I convinced Yannis and Sophia ... 

430
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,260
 They sent me to collect information about you. 

431
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,700
 Then we will give them what they want. 

432
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,760
 We will give them more confidence in you. 

433
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,100
 What do you want me to say? 

434
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,940
 You tell them that I'm about to save the oboe from the Balgay scourge. 

435
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,640
 They will ask how to do this. 

436
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,140
 I have something to whet Balgay's appetite. 

437
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,600
 The laws of Genghis Khan. 

438
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,320
 Knowing this ... 

439
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,660
 They will worry. 

440
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,480
 The worried fox quickly fell into the trap. 

441
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,360
 Come on. 

442
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,460
 Apply what I say literally. 

443
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,320
 You couldn't handle the privates tied ... 

444
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,180
 Are you trying to women now? 

445
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,100
 Bastard! 

446
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,340
 Look at me, Mongolian dog. 

447
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,800
 What happened? 

448
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,080
 Did you mind to fly? 

449
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,420
 When Osman Bey came, you all swallowed your little tongue. 

450
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,180
 Do not rush this much ... 

451
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,660
 It will be your turn to all of you. 

452
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,560
 To all of you. 

453
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,020
 The devil's son ... 

454
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,080
 Wait Basin. 

455
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,480
 I will strangle you with my own hands. 

456
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,320
 If I don't take your meat off your bones ... 

457
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
 They should not say to me too. 

458
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,420
 The slanted pattern of the eyes is not slanted ... 

459
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,900
 If I say ending from the ground ... 

460
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,800
 You are not at all. 

461
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,220
 What did this Mongolian do to you? 

462
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,920
 You became your dog. 

463
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,080
 Understood. 

464
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,540
 You are mankurt. 

465
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,140
 Mankurt. 

466
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
 What did you say to me? 

467
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Repeat Ersen. 

468
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,880
 Tell me! 

469
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,280
 I said... 

470
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,440
 If I don't take your meat off your bones ... 

471
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,760
 Mankurt whether they call me Konur. 

472
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,060
 Untie it! 

473
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,860
 Mongolian pus! 

474
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,660
 Genetic dog! 

475
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,060
 Come to Göktuğ, son. 

476
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,340
 Mom, look, I have the same. 

477
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,640
 Of course, son. 

478
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,340
 We have all the privates. 

479
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,920
 Father. 

480
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
 Konur, Göktuğ ... 

481
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,880
 I will prove to laugh at you. 

482
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,520
 Don't be hoped that Osman Bey will save you. 

483
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
 We are quite ... 

484
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,960
 This world will be forbidden to you. 

485
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,100
 Thread! 

486
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,560
 Balgay is his command, and he will live until he notifies. 

487
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,580
 Thread. 

488
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,120
 Selamun aleykum. 

489
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,440
 And hey hello. 

490
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,460
 Since he came here unharmed ... 

491
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,320
 Balgay the ... 

492
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,480
 It is clear that you are burning the ambition of power. 

493
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,360
 Now we arrive ... 

494
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,720
 My brothers awaiting death ... 

495
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,140
 The mother of Selcan ... 

496
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,280
 I will save Oba from Balgay's persecution. 

497
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,820
 Then with the permission of Allah ... 

498
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,860
 Our first big war will start then. 

499
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,340
 I Bismillahirahmanirah. 

500
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,860
 I hid it like my eyes. 

501
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,700
 May Allah be pleased with you, Sheikh. 

502
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,140
 It is your first fight with Mongolian. 

503
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,680
 The first battles are tough. 

504
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,700
 It's too hard. 

505
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,480
 Lord ... 

506
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,400
 With his Companions ... 

507
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,580
 When his first battle went to Badr ... 

508
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
 The polytheists with their arrogance ... 

509
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,420
 Kutlu was belittling the army ... 

510
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,760
 They boasted of their powers. 

511
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,180
 So ... 

512
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,600
 They underestimated the Muslims. 

513
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,000
 But... 

514
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,180
 Our master was always awake ... 

515
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,580
 Our Prophet... 

516
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,940
 To the wells where the battle of Badr 

517
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,480
 By arriving before the polytheists ... 

518
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,540
 He closed the wells one by one. 

519
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,980
 In that desert heat ... 

520
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,560
 He made moves to compensate for his weakness. 

521
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,680
 After completing all his preparations ... 

522
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,400
 He opened his hand and graced it ... 

523
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,560
 The prophet of mercy ... 

524
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,160
 He delivered his army to his Lord. 

525
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,600
 My Lord answered him too ... 

526
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,940
 My God... 

527
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,260
 Ali says during the time of imran that ... 

528
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,160
 "Certainly, Bedir is you ... 

529
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,640
 While weaker ... 

530
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,560
 Allah helped you ... 

531
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,920
 And it gave victory. 

532
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,300
 Live in accordance with Allah's orders ... 

533
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,600
 Thank God. " 

534
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,280
 I hope my Lord supports us with an army of angels. 

535
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,200
 We also achieve victory. 

536
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,580
 This is in your hands, Osman. 

537
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,000
 How is my Sheikh? 

538
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,300
 You will not lose your sincerity and blasphemy. 

539
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,900
 You will do your job with love. 

540
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,920
 For... 

541
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,980
 The work without love would be fruitless. 

542
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,040
 But this love ... 

543
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,900
 It shouldn't just be a love for Leyla. 

544
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,220
 Lord ... 

545
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,300
 For the sake of love for the Lord ... 

546
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,540
 Taif also stoned. 

547
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,520
 He did not bow to the oppressors. 

548
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,420
 Enemies could not scare your eyes. 

549
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,940
 While setting the table ... 

550
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,400
 While shaking pusat ... 

551
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,220
 Toy also spoke ... 

552
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,680
 While listening to the troubles ... 

553
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,280
 You shouldn't lose your love ... 

554
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,820
 If you lose your love ... 

555
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,540
 Your consciousness goes first ... 

556
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,220
 Satan rides his ego ... 

557
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
 And it will slave you to yourself. 

558
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,180
 Son of love with your mind. 

559
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,440
 So ... 

560
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,240
 Let the dark clouds spread over Islam. 

561
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,160
 Let it end. 

562
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,700
 Let justice end. 

563
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,440
 Resurrection fever ... 

564
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,460
 Let it harle again. 

565
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,660
 O Allah, Sheikh. 

566
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,040
 I surrounded the zeal. 

567
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,940
 I will fight until the end. 

568
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,840
 Lets... 

569
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,220
 If we extend the word too much ... 

570
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,580
 Balgay will kill the lineage. 

571
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,640
 Ya Allah! 

572
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,860
 Bismillah! 

573
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,080
 Thread! 

574
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,500
 What did you plunge, son? 

575
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,240
 Nothing main. 

576
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,260
 Say, well. 

577
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,200
 I had a brother ... 

578
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,980
 They took it too. 

579
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,760
 What do you say, son? 

580
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,520
 No way ... 

581
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,880
 Whether it is the main ... 

582
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,860
 What happens to my Lord? 

583
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,740
 No, princess? 

584
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,380
 Have you lost your way? 

585
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,580
 What are you looking for? 

586
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,780
 I have come to your visit for the past. 

587
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,520
 Come, come. 

588
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,560
 Did the Mongols hurt you a lot? 

589
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,320
 Osman Bey can not break now. 

590
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,280
 They are miserable. 

591
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,660
 Look at those. 

592
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,660
 Obese for a thousand years ... 

593
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,760
 We have not been overruled for a thousand years, evelallah. 

594
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,120
 With the snake like you ... 

595
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,080
 If we were to be afraid of the jackal like Balgay ... 

596
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,420
 We would not stand up like this. 

597
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,700
 Are you holding your head tied in your own dungeon? 

598
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,820
 You are pathetic. 

599
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,540
 Thank you Osman ... 

600
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,180
 He expelled Alişar to Balga. 

601
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,140
 Alishar is gone. 

602
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,940
 Now the princess ... 

603
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,700
 Did he look at Balgay's bed? 

604
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,300
 No, princess? 

605
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,760
 My word touched the princess's arrogance. 

606
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:01,780
 You burn to get the life that Balgay can't take. 

607
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,140
 I can only laugh at this state, Sophia. 

608
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,800
 When your oba is painted with your blood ... 

609
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,340
 You will see my last smiling eyes. 

610
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,780
 Selcan Hatun. 

611
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,740
 You have those eyes ... 

612
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,920
 It does not suit us to die without carving them. 

613
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,260
 Without seeing that your skins are swimming ... 

614
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,280
 I Ölmice. 

615
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,140
 I will come to your funeral. 

616
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,740
 Look at what we're falling. 

617
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,680
 O God, my God. 

618
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,620
 There is no news from Osman Bey. 

619
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,960
 We do not know what works where. 

620
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,380
 How do we bear this bell? 

621
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,140
 Kill us. 

622
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,000
 Souls ... 

623
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,520
 Siblings... 

624
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,860
 Our Supreme Lord ... 

625
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,700
 The Qur'an also says ... 

626
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,760
 I Bismillahirahmanirah. 

627
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,240
 "What you have done before you ... 

628
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,320
 Çekmedik by ... 

629
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,480
 You cannot enter paradise. " 

630
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,540
 Language is also easy to believe. 

631
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,720
 It is hard to be patient in the test, brothers. 

632
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,200
 Siblings... 

633
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,000
 Patience brothers! 

634
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,300
 What face does this Eurasian obese come to? 

635
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,580
 Let me see ... 

636
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,760
 Let me go! 

637
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,900
 Let's! 

638
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,120
 What the hell is he doing? 

639
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,940
 You will not get out of your bed before Osman Bey arrives. 

640
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,700
 Since we have all the brave blood in his hand, he came to the place without shame ... 

641
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,980
 They do business with Balgay. 

642
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,800
 They will not go without drying our root. 

643
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,500
 That nail ... 

644
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,220
 When I first came to Oba, I should have been pregnant. 

645
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,720
 What did you do on time that Mr. Dundar? 

646
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,640
 I said be a complaint to Osman ... 

647
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,900
 You did not listen. 

648
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,020
 I said to be preventing Edebalı ... 

649
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,820
 You did not listen. 

650
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,920
 All of them have now joined together ... 

651
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,040
 They make us from our country and our soul. 

652
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,020
 Zöhre ... 

653
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,340
 Enough! 

654
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,940
 They will take our son from us ... 

655
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,480
 They will break our brave, sapling. 

656
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,680
 It's all because of Osman. 

657
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,960
 If they mean my son's life ... 

658
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,980
 You should know that my hand will be on both sides. 

659
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,280
 Babes! 

660
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,860
 I said enough! 

661
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,640
 You couldn't take care of Oba ... 

662
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,380
 You couldn't take care of Osman ... 

663
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,120
 Now put your tooth on me? 

664
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,400
 Enough! 

665
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,700
 Come on. 

666
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,920
 Come on shoot! 

667
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,920
 You try to scare me anyway. 

668
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:30,980
 It was enough. 

669
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,680
 Yetti. 

670
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,140
 Enough! 

671
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,100
 You will go crawling before Balgay, babe. 

672
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,220
 What did you bring to me? 

673
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,140
 Master Yannis mobilized the spies in Byzantium. 

674
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,480
 We are ready for the big war. 

675
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,460
 As I told Yannis ... 

676
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,160
 the castle ... 

677
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,200
 the governor ... 

678
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,080
 All kinds of stability coming from the armies of the emperor ... 

679
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,260
 First I will know. 

680
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,280
 You have no doubt about it. 

681
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,020
 Hisar tekfuru will come to see you. 

682
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,800
 Do not doubt that he will die without seeing you. 

683
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,000
 The rest is your soldiers' job. 

684
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,500
 Will you give me another? 

685
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,680
 Balgay doesn't always do this. 

686
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,360
 I want you to follow the promises you made to me. 

687
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,180
 How dare you talk to me like that. 

688
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,800
 Princess! 

689
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,820
 Why didn't you kill Osman and his alps that came to your feet? 

690
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,520
 How do you know that Osman came to the place? 

691
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,520
 We said we have eyes and ears everywhere ... 

692
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,340
 Even in the plains of the Turks. 

693
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,980
 Didn't you believe us? 

694
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,000
 I released Osman ... 

695
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,440
 The laws of Genghis Khan ... 

696
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,940
 Why is it so important? 

697
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,640
 So you know that too? 

698
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,480
 And you... 

699
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,440
 You believed Osman's words. 

700
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,720
 Is that so? 

701
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,680
 When you brought the laws ... 

702
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,040
 He will take what he wants from me. 

703
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,820
 On behalf of Genghis Khan's laws ... 

704
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,540
 And I drank. 

705
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,360
 Let's say he brought ... 

706
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,040
 And then? 

707
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,600
 Especially let me get it ... 

708
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,040
 Osman's account ... 

709
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,220
 You see that. 

710
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:47,040
 Let's come. 

711
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,040
 Genghis Khan's laws mean? 

712
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
 With your new owner ... 

713
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:27,380
 You dream of your queen in Constanin Sophia? 

714
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,100
 My eyes are sharper than you. 

715
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:34,220
 My ear is more hole. 

716
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,100
 My pusat is sharper. 

717
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,880
 Osman... 

718
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,260
 Again, you try to do more than your height. 

719
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,340
 If you die so long ... 

720
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,260
 Don't tire us further. 

721
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,300
 I will see your account one day, Sophia. 

722
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
 And you know that day is not far at all. 

723
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,940
 Did you bring the laws of Genghis Khan? 

724
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,800
 I would like to see it too, but ... 

725
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,000
 The pen is also very ... 

726
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,420
 I have a lot of work. 

727
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,820
 Say hi to Yannis ... 

728
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,520
 We will comment. 

729
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,760
 Say hello to Edebalı. 

730
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,820
 Sophie ... 

731
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,520
 He will take his life soon. 

732
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,260
 I get it. 

733
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,440
 Bring it to me. 

734
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,980
 Do not forget the oath you have in front of the gentlemen. 

735
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,600
 Keep your word ... 

736
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,620
 Get up from my father's post. 

737
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,080
 Enough. 

738
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,820
 Give me the law. 

739
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,900
 Keep your word ... 

740
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,420
 Unleash my Alps. 

741
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,740
 Withdraw your troops from my obese. 

742
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
 Bitter ... 

743
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,180
 With me... 

744
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,140
 If you don't stay in your oath ... 

745
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,780
 Geyhatu learns that you have the laws of Cengiz Han. 

746
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,960
 An alpine awaits to let Geyhatu learn the truth. 

747
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,980
 You... 

748
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,960
 You know why I offered Sancak Principality? 

749
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:36,300
 The biggest enemies of Genghis Khan at the time ... 

750
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,080
 Her... 

751
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,320
 His best friends ... 

752
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,540
 He became his best buddies and commanders. 

753
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,120
 In one of the wars ... 

754
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,620
 He shot a valiant arrow on Genghis Khan ... 

755
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,160
 And he managed to hurt him. 

756
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,540
 When Cenk is finished ... 

757
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,020
 Chief Commander Taytaylu ... 

758
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,920
 He reached the prisoners ... 

759
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,440
 The arrow asked who was throwing ... 

760
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,640
 A soldier ... 

761
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,320
 Stand out with courage ... 

762
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,640
 Ok, I said I threw it ... 

763
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,520
 Cengiz Han, impressed by the courage of the soldier ... 

764
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,700
 He made him a commander to his army ... 

765
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,220
 As well as... 

766
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,680
 Putting his name Cebe, which means ok, to him ... 

767
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,460
 He honored him ... 

768
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,900
 With Cebe Subutay ... 

769
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,800
 He became one of the greatest commanders of the Mongolian army. 

770
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
 I am a servant of Allah first ... 

771
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
 Then I am the son of Ertuğrul Gazi. 

772
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,960
 We also obey Allah before obey ... 

773
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,820
 Then it is the ceremony. 

774
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,940
 Now leave the oboe with your soldiers. 

775
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,960
 Come. 

776
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,800
 My son Osman Bey came. 

777
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,880
 It is time. 

778
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,460
 This Balgay will not trust your reputation. 

779
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
 You heard the command of lions ... 

780
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,440
 The moment they don't stop talking ... 

781
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,900
 We will add the oba to each other. 

782
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,660
 Is the car ready? 

783
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,140
 Everything is ready, sir. 

784
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,500
 You brought us up for these days, evelallah. 

785
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,240
 I hope my bravery. 

786
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,880
 Mongolian shroud ... 

787
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,480
 What was it to occupy the Muslim homeland ... 

788
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,240
 He will see with his eyes. 

789
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,940
 Your eyes are gazelle heart wolves. 

790
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,920
 Well, my beautiful son. 

791
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,980
 He brought the laws of Osman Cengiz Han. 

792
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,140
 No one can stand in front of Balgay anymore. 

793
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,040
 Samsa Bey ... 

794
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,460
 Where did Osman find this? 

795
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,920
 I don't know where he got it, but ... 

796
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,820
 Osman Bey will save us ... 

797
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,700
 It will bring all the Mongolian together. 

798
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,460
 My Samsa Bey, Osman Bey, of course knows something. 

799
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,100
 There are. 

800
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:56,320
 It is obvious that he knows a lot that we do not know. 

801
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,280
 Spirits hope you ... 

802
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,100
 He gave me strength. 

803
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,660
 Free the prisoners. 

804
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,400
 They should know ... 

805
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,020
 Balgay donated their lives. 

806
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,380
 Mr. Dundar ... 

807
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,680
 Let the news of the Oba gentlemen around the thesis ... 

808
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,300
 You say ... 

809
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,900
 Come to the presence of Balgay. 

810
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,440
 Balgay, if anyone gets thirsty ... 

811
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,940
 Want to see. 

812
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,960
 If you have enough life ... 

813
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,440
 He wants to feed. 

814
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,660
 Wiping off his rod ... 

815
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,180
 If anyone wants ... 

816
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,380
 It wants to delete. 

817
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,820
 You say that for obedience ... 

818
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,700
 Let them come to my feet. 

819
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,760
 Genghis Khan's laws ... 

820
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,500
 What are you doing? 

821
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,400
 Why am I not aware of these, Osman? 

822
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,000
 Emmi ... 

823
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,400
 Valiantly from death ... 

824
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,640
 I saved the oba from destruction. 

825
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,760
 Now you will think ... 

826
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,100
 In this case, how to carry my father's trust. 

827
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,180
 I don't want a revolt. 

828
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,920
 Tread lightly. 

829
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,020
 I Baturina ... 

830
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,220
 He would die because of you. 

831
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,740
 The poison you injected into the Alps ... 

832
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,920
 You also injured my child. 

833
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,240
 Freedom is poison. 

834
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,380
 Once in the blood of the man ... 

835
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:26,180
 It will never come out again. 

836
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,820
 Because of your stubbornness ... 

837
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,920
 They will burn the oba and destroy it ... 

838
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,620
 You still talk. 

839
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,700
 It is enough. 

840
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,500
 Enough. 

841
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,060
 Ha oba demolished ... 

842
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,880
 Ha peace. 

843
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,560
 You put Balgay's collar on your neck. 

844
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,940
 Happy birthday, 

845
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,600
 Deserves to sit down. 

846
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,260
 When I got out of that post ... 

847
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,560
 Who will sit there. 

848
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,900
 Who! 

849
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,180
 I! 

850
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,260
 Ertuğrul Gazi's son Osman! 

851
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,940
 There are toys in the evening ... 

852
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,620
 You will come to give account, Osman. 

853
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,000
 Account. 

854
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,700
 You cannot trust them. 

855
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,460
 Keep the Kayi oba and Samsa's oba in mind. 

856
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,580
 You're welcome, Balgay. 

857
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,180
 Osman found the way to save his oba. 

858
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
 How did he solve this job? 

859
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,360
 Where did he get it? 

860
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,140
 It may be the work of the Literary and the hymns. 

861
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,240
 Damn, to Edebalı or to the family ... 

862
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,660
 Not literary ... 

863
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,600
 Even his power is not enough. 

864
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
 There is something else, but what? 

865
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,320
 Salvador... 

866
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,660
 Didn't Osman say anything about it? 

867
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,680
 No, sir. 

868
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,520
 Whatever this secret is ... 

869
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,740
 Osman hides it to his death. 

870
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,200
 In that case... 

871
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,220
 He won't be able to keep it for a long time. 

872
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,160
 As soon as Balgay leaves his collar ... 

873
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,580
 I will hunt Osman. 

874
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,580
 We have a guiding pleasure. 

875
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,100
 He knows well enough to smell our prey from afar. 

876
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,740
 Moreover... 

877
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,720
 What he said so far turned out to be true. 

878
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,920
 I told you I wouldn't die without hurting myself, Master Yannis. 

879
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,540
 I know where she hides Edebalı. 

880
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,180
 We will deserve it all at once. 

881
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,340
 The liberation is close to Bala Hatun. 

882
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,520
 We will send the Mongolian to where it came from. 

883
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,060
 How did you achieve this, Osman Bey? 

884
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,300
 The original law of Cengiz Han for years was missing. 

885
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,520
 How did you find it? 

886
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,640
 Khidr does not catch up without the slave. 

887
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,360
 Let's say it has reached our rescue. 

888
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,940
 Who is Khidr Osman? 

889
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,920
 I said secret, Bala Hatun. 

890
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,340
 Is it a secret to me? 

891
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,580
 What you say I love ... 

892
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,240
 For the sake of burning the world for your sake ... 

893
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,440
 Is it a secret to your hat? 

894
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,280
 Now you know ... 

895
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,460
 If you are going to share a life with me ... 

896
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,520
 You won't know my secrets. 

897
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,180
 You will stop where I said stop. 

898
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,040
 Where it is necessary to keep quiet ... 

899
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,180
 You're gonna shut up. 

900
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,460
 I'm a daughter, Osman Bey ... 

901
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,180
 If I will be comrade to my spouse ... 

902
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,700
 I would like to know your secret. 

903
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,900
 I would like to stand next to you like a mountain. 

904
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,400
 Come with him and ... 

905
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,580
 I want to take life. 

906
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:10,100
 I don't look like the chicks you know! 

907
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,860
 Excuse me. 

908
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,680
 Excuse is yours. 

909
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,520
 Selamun aleykum. 

910
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,200
 Aleyküm Selam. 

911
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,520
 You have reached thesis range. 

912
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,260
 You hit the wild place, sir. 

913
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,860
 No, Samsa Sergeant? 

914
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,840
 You look awkward? 

915
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,040
 How was this job Osman Bey? 

916
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,480
 What happened to the phrase that meant our soul? 

917
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,820
 Every lock has a key, Samsa Bey. 

918
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,200
 The important thing is ... 

919
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,340
 The key is who's standing in your waist. 

920
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,480
 You're wrong, Samsa Bey. 

921
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,840
 The important thing is whether the door is opened. 

922
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,400
 That door has been opened, now we are speedy. 

923
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,720
 What is Companionship, Osman Bey? 

924
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,240
 What is fraternity? 

925
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,980
 Why wouldn't you tell us? 

926
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,440
 Nobody gave us our liberty, Samsa Bey. 

927
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,760
 We got it. 

928
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,560
 I can't say this to anyone. 

929
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,540
 When I leaned on you, I met two mountains and became a mountain. 

930
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,900
 But I was wrong. 

931
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,160
 I am husband Samsa Bey ... 

932
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,380
 He put his nafs under his feet and ... 

933
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,520
 I served you like an alpine. 

934
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,460
 Samsa Bey ... 

935
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,040
 The backbone of the persecution hits our face ... 

936
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:32,620
 We have a hard time. 

937
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,320
 If we don't understand each other on this path ... 

938
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,320
 It is obvious that wild rivers have entered us. 

939
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:41,620
 It is evident that our wind will be blown away by our separate water. 

940
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,440
 I don't see, I don't know ... 

941
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,420
 Moreover, when I feel that I am not trusted ... 

942
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,080
 I don't stop on that road anymore. 

943
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:54,140
 Samsa Bey ... 

944
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:56,560
 Let it be in my face in black winter. 

945
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,520
 If a secret has come between us ... 

946
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,340
 I walk the liberty road alone. 

947
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:13,240
 If any, my right is lawful to you. 

948
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,080
 Genghis Khan's ... 

949
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,140
 I have the soul ... 

950
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:42,300
 Act ... 

951
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,840
 Me too! 

952
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,380
 From now on... 

953
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,700
 With the spirit of Genghis Khan ... 

954
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,260
 With the power of the law ... 

955
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,900
 West... 

956
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,180
 Eastward... 

957
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,380
 South... 

958
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,240
 And to the North ... 

959
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:34,340
 the land ... 

960
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,820
 the sea ... 

961
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,740
 To the mountains and the skies ... 

962
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,120
 All is with me. 

963
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,620
 Spirits are with me ... 

964
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,400
 My anger inside me ... 

965
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,380
 My blood ... 

966
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,900
 Tutus are ... 

967
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,120
 You my valiant warriors ... 

968
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,060
 In front of my loyal soldiers' eyes ... 

969
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,700
 Of my dead ancestors ... 

970
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,880
 In front of their spirits ... 

971
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,900
 And the great Genghis Khan ... 

972
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,300
 In front of his soul ... 

973
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,860
 Genghis Khan's law ... 

974
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,380
 I seal my tongue with fire. 

975
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,140
 Celebrate death ... 

976
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,760
 Ancestors of my ancestor spirits ... 

977
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,420
 In front of my soldiers ... 

978
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,960
 Balgay the ... 

979
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,720
 The oath. 

980
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:17,980
 Cihan ... 

981
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,440
 We went out to rule ... 

982
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,260
 From the Gobi deserts ... 

983
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,200
 Tengri mountains ... 

984
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:27,260
 We crossed the Caspian seas. 

985
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,100
 Our path is Constantine. 

986
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,720
 Our way is the way of blood! 

987
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,480
 What are the fancy dogs of the Byzantine ... 

988
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,840
 What vicious Turks ... 

989
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:00,780
 He won't be able to turn us out of our way. 

990
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,960
 Like Osman ... 

991
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,320
 Rebels ... 

992
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,900
 On our shaman drums ... 

993
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:14,540
 It will be stretched leather. 

994
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:16,780
 With bones ... 

995
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,040
 Hit your skins ... 

996
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:23,100
 We will rise above their bodies. 

997
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,620
 Swimming in their blood ... 

998
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,060
 We will cross the seas. 

999
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,140
 Crush me if I stop ... 

1000
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,960
 If I get tired, chew me ... 

1001
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:44,380
 In your horse's hooves. 

1002
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,660
 If you stop ... 

1003
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,680
 Be my enemy ... 

1004
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,620
 If you focus ... 

1005
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,260
 In the hands of the spirits ... 

1006
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,360
 Suffering forever. 

1007
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,420
 Genghis Khan's law ... 

1008
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:32,960
 Slice ... 

1009
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,900
 I'm sealed with fire. 

1010
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,800
 I Bismillahirahmanirah ... 

1011
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:38,460
 When you say be ... 

1012
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,080
 Filling our hearts with the spirit of faith ... 

1013
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,700
 With the 99 names of Allah Almighty. 

1014
01:41:58,980 --> 01:41:59,800
 My gentlemen ... 

1015
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,580
 Black days ... 

1016
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,340
 He captured our obese. 

1017
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,780
 Mongolian says I'm gone ... 

1018
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:07,140
 Not that... 

1019
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:10,900
 It is not certain that he will not return tomorrow. 

1020
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,160
 We are here to discuss the situation. 

1021
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,500
 I've been here for so many years ... 

1022
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:23,500
 I have not seen another alpine holding an unaware of the gentleman. 

1023
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:26,080
 Osman... 

1024
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,840
 Unaware of you and the toy ... 

1025
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,300
 Dundar Bey put a rod in the beehive of the Mongols. 

1026
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,820
 We heard that you refused Balgay's Sancak Bey proposal. 

1027
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,420
 What can you do with confidence? 

1028
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,300
 Osman, this great offer ... 

1029
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:50,820
 He accepted politics politically ... 

1030
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:53,440
 These wouldn't happen to us. 

1031
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,700
 It doesn't come now. 

1032
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:58,420
 What about future? 

1033
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,100
 Doesn't our generation say ... 

1034
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,940
 As if they had hit the Mongol collar on the neck of our ancestor ... 

1035
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,400
 They did not fight for liberty. 

1036
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,680
 Don't they say they're scared and run away? 

1037
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,700
 Now I ask you ... 

1038
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,760
 In this world that we do not rule even a breath ... 

1039
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,880
 For a sigh of relief ... 

1040
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:26,180
 Are we going to be a Mongolian neck? 

1041
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:28,060
 Will we take orders? 

1042
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,200
 Are we going to be slaves? 

1043
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,080
 You won't talk to your mind, my nephew. 

1044
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,740
 You're after dreams. 

1045
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,360
 Mongolian ruling the world ... 

1046
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,920
 Will you beat it? 

1047
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,860
 I will beat. 

1048
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,200
 You will beat ... 

1049
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,880
 Dündar Bey will beat ... 

1050
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,640
 Mr. Gündüz will be defeated. 

1051
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,740
 Our smith will beat. 

1052
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
 Şahin Bey will be defeated. 

1053
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,360
 Atam Kürşat ... 

1054
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:05,420
 Just as China lit the walls ... 

1055
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,980
 Atam Alparslan ... 

1056
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:10,520
 Just as he kneeled against Romanian ... 

1057
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,960
 Atam Selahattin ... 

1058
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,460
 How he got Jerusalem from the crusaders. 

1059
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,960
 We can also crush the oppressors. 

1060
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,500
 Let's just believe it. 

1061
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,300
 Our dry mouth is full, Osman. 

1062
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,360
 We don't want turmoil anymore. 

1063
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,120
 This is the tip, Şahin Bey. 

1064
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:40,980
 There is a price to live in these lands. 

1065
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,120
 And who does not pay this price ... 

1066
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:45,100
 It is doomed to disappear. 

1067
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,920
 We are here because we pay those costs. 

1068
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:50,580
 We want peace now. 

1069
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,820
 We wish to be rested and rested. 

1070
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,420
 Those who want tranquility ... 

1071
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,000
 Those who wish to rest have no place at this end. 

1072
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,220
 Those who have no job at this end ... 

1073
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,160
 Not those who sacrifice everything ... 

1074
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,240
 They're the ones who got their oboe in trouble where we stopped. 

1075
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,200
 What do you mean? 

1076
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,940
 Talk straight, Demirci. 

1077
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,700
 Mongolian is now at our bottom. 

1078
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:30,740
 If we uphold, it won't breathe us. 

1079
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:38,060
 As Ertuğrul Gazi's heirloom ... 

1080
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,800
 We were patient with Osman ... 

1081
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,040
 However, the knife rested on the bone. 

1082
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,680
 Osman... 

1083
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,400
 Let him leave. 

1084
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:06,780
 I hoped your eyes would laugh ... 

1085
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,220
 But they vomit Bala. 

1086
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,360
 Osman Bey is not his wife ... 

1087
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,840
 He wants to choose a slave. 

1088
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,880
 How about you Bala? 

1089
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,040
 She wants a wife like milk milking women. 

1090
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,460
 This is not because I belittled the pussies. 

1091
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,640
 I was saddened that he had not yet recognized me. 

1092
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,560
 He is unaware of how comrade will come. 

1093
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,360
 Bala ... 

1094
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,100
 Although he doesn't know ... 

1095
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,760
 You know what kind of heart he gives to a man. 

1096
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,620
 The real skill is ... 

1097
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,600
 Is not the mad foals tame action? 

1098
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:14,580
 Oh Osman! 

1099
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,000
 It was Osman's move that took us from this narrow ... 

1100
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,600
 You are wrong, Mr. Gündüz ... 

1101
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:25,820
 Bringing the Mongolian here ... 

1102
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,340
 Wasn't it what Osman did? 

1103
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:34,260
 You don't even know what's in front of you. 

1104
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,520
 Sophia came here ... 

1105
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,540
 As soon as the villains form an united evil alliance? 

1106
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:46,700
 Your only concern is to survive. 

1107
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:52,220
 What about your isolation? 

1108
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,960
 While you are on my father's path ... 

1109
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,500
 Didn't you know that this would happen to you? 

1110
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,800
 Say ... 

1111
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,300
 What about you uncle? 

1112
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:10,140
 I... 

1113
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,840
 I came to this land through many wars. 

1114
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,680
 We are with your father ... 

1115
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:18,860
 With my brother Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

1116
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,320
 The most difficult conditions ... 

1117
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,400
 We would have consulted and made a decision. 

1118
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,780
 Nobody could have done this to you. 

1119
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
 How many times have I said ... 

1120
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:49,940
 But I couldn't listen to you. 

1121
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,680
 Oba has become a tarumar. 

1122
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,960
 Willow is out of hand. 

1123
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:00,140
 A second blow ... 

1124
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,500
 Nobody can lift it. 

1125
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,340
 What about you Bamsı? 

1126
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,800
 You have no sound. 

1127
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,260
 How about you? 

1128
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:32,300
 Mr. Demirci ... 

1129
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:35,180
 And İbrahim Bey ... 

1130
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,920
 Truth speaks. 

1131
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,480
 Your stove as soon as possible ... 

1132
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:07,860
 It is necessary to go to salute ... 

1133
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,800
 Mr. Dundar ... 

1134
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,820
 The decision is yours. 

1135
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,300
 What about you... 

1136
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:27,300
 Apturrahman Gazi ... 

1137
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,360
 You devoted your life to the fight of the beech ... 

1138
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,600
 You helped Ertuğrul veteran. 

1139
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:36,700
 How about you? 

1140
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,660
 The provision of the Oghuz ceremony is clear ... 

1141
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:03,840
 Peace of the obe ... 

1142
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,060
 It is above everyone .. 

1143
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:15,220
 Mr. Bamsi ... 

1144
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:16,520
 It tells the truth. 

1145
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:25,880
 Me too... 

1146
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,740
 I agree the same. 

1147
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:37,240
 For my greetings ... 

1148
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,260
 My nephew Osman's exile ... 

1149
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,900
 I approve. 

1150
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:56,880
 Furying on your heart. 

1151
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,080
 Father's words are not enough ... 

1152
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,760
 You also go to the word of gentleman. 

1153
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,880
 If you talk a lot, I will send you to exile, if I say child. 

1154
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,000
 Oba will stay and eat bondage bite ... 

1155
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,920
 I drink martyrdom with Osman. 

1156
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:26,600
 Since ... 

1157
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,700
 My absence will bring peace to the oba ... 

1158
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,240
 Then it goes to me too. 

1159
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:44,340
 But you will not forget. 

1160
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:47,960
 Hürriyet talk ... 

1161
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,440
 Not with abuse ... 

1162
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:54,560
 It is taken with pusat. 

1163
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:33,020
 My God... 

1164
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,740
 For many years, you test the servant of Konur ... 

1165
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,980
 Brotherhood longing ... 

1166
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:42,180
 My dear, my Lord. 

1167
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,040
 You know my heart best ... 

1168
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:48,180
 You see best. 

1169
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:56,580
 If... 

1170
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,400
 Serving Mongolian ... 

1171
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,980
 Kong ... 

1172
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:04,420
 My brother is ... 

1173
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:07,660
 You grant him guidance. 

1174
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:12,420
 If he resists believing ... 

1175
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,560
 With my own hands ... 

1176
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:20,100
 Allow me to take his life. 

1177
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:07,920
 Exile... 

1178
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,360
 What do you say? 

1179
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,920
 We'll all go into exile in the morning, brother. 

1180
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:18,840
 I'm Bamsı? 

1181
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,700
 Wasn't Bamsı Bey toyy? 

1182
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,020
 How did he allow it? 

1183
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,080
 Particularly, Bamsı Bey and Apturrahman Gazi wanted us to go. 

1184
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:40,740
 My Osman Bey said that we will arrive at my osa of Samsa at sunrise. 

1185
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,840
 What about Samsa Sergeant? What will happen if he doesn't accept us into his obas? 

1186
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:52,360
 I don't know, brother ... 

1187
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,400
 Oh my boran ah. 

1188
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,420
 Here is Selcan Hatun. 

1189
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:39,460
 Hey gone Bamsı Bey hey ... 

1190
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:43,960
 Did we see them today? 

1191
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:48,040
 You are the father half of Osman ... 

1192
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,860
 Mentor, arm wing ... 

1193
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,900
 Did you name the enemy Osman? 

1194
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,240
 I'll tell you, Bamsı Bey! 

1195
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,020
 Don't you hear? 

1196
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,660
 Did you turn your face to Osman? 

1197
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:13,500
 Do you take care of this, to the trust of your comrade? 

1198
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,320
 Selcan Hatun stop and say nothing more! 

1199
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:24,600
 Mongolian fire ... 

1200
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:27,180
 He burned our object to his heart. 

1201
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:32,880
 You also lived Selcan Hatun. 

1202
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,980
 Mongolian scourge like a storm ... 

1203
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:39,020
 He drags what he adds to him. 

1204
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,260
 Oba gentlemen are angry. 

1205
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,320
 Osman became mobile without telling me. 

1206
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,600
 Osman get away from the oba. 

1207
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,480
 Get away so that you can recover. 

1208
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,020
 Don't try to get more toyed. 

1209
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,180
 Selcan Hatun ... 

1210
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:09,440
 You know too ... 

1211
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,220
 Valiant cook over a fire. 

1212
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:14,160
 If Osman doesn't cook either ... 

1213
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:16,820
 The carpet becomes miserable. 

1214
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:25,280
 Selcan Hatun ... 

1215
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,100
 Do not worry. 

1216
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,840
 I do not take my eyes off my Osman. 

1217
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,360
 Welcome me, Bamsı Bey. 

1218
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,120
 Mine is the mother's heart. 

1219
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:44,860
 My anxiety is from him. 

1220
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:49,780
 Forgive me. 

1221
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:54,220
 Thank you, Selcan Hatun. 

1222
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,380
 My God... 

1223
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:52,020
 If I'm fighting for my ego ... 

1224
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:56,020
 Bring me to myself. 

1225
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,720
 If I'm fighting for glory ... 

1226
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:04,860
 You bring me down. 

1227
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:09,860
 On this path I took ... 

1228
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:11,280
 My only goal ... 

1229
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,960
 To gain your consent, O Lord. 

1230
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:17,420
 If you intend ... 

1231
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:21,980
 If he returns to my place, office and position ... 

1232
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,520
 You take my life. 

1233
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:17,520
 But my head is upright. 

1234
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,440
 Whatever I did, I was for the oblivion of this oba. 

1235
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,400
 I did not bow to Sancak Bey ... 

1236
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,260
 I was not afraid of Byzantium. 

1237
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,600
 I wasn't a mongolian suspus. 

1238
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:42,080
 I learned to stand up straight from you, Dad. 

1239
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,280
 His courage is from Bamsı. 

1240
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:53,080
 Loyalty from Apturrahman Gazi. 

1241
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:01,880
 I'll go now. 

1242
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,680
 But of course I will be back. 

1243
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,440
 Son... 

1244
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,220
 You are the rightful owner of this bed. 

1245
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:36,580
 Because Dündar Bey mail was established ... 

1246
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:39,140
 No one but my father can send me from this quarters mother. 

1247
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:43,680
 My departure is not exile. 

1248
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,460
 If I stay ... 

1249
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:48,280
 I must be subject to Dündar Bey. 

1250
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:51,660
 You know I can't. 

1251
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,120
 Don't take too long, son. 

1252
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,200
 You know too ... 

1253
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:03,480
 Dündar Bey is not the man to glorify the glory of the beech. 

1254
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:07,080
 What happens if you become an Iraqi? 

1255
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:08,920
 worry ... 

1256
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:12,080
 On time, my grandfather Süleyman Şah ... 

1257
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:16,380
 I do not leave this place where my father Ertuğrul Gazi carries his honor. 

1258
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:20,920
 If I don't go now ... 

1259
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:23,920
 The cruelty to me is to walk past Dundar Bey. 

1260
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,100
 The waterfall slides all over. 

1261
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,440
 I go ... 

1262
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,660
 With the liberty in time ... 

1263
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:33,940
 With power ... 

1264
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:36,220
 I'll be back with an iron fist ... 

1265
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:38,340
 Since then ... 

1266
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:40,820
 May he wish to stick to the skirt of Dündar Bey. 

1267
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,780
 May you join the accident with me. 

1268
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,240
 You must halal your mother. 

1269
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:55,980
 Get halal until the end. 

1270
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,720
 He went with the Alps ... 

1271
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:27,180
 He finally found what he deserved. 

1272
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:28,820
 Thank god. 

1273
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:31,520
 We will never be able to haunt these troubles again. 

1274
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:41,860
 You don't know what you're doing. 

1275
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:45,900
 You are immersed in your own darkness ... 

1276
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:48,060
 You don't see Osman's light. 

1277
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:51,260
 Shame on you. 

1278
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:52,900
 Batur! 

1279
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:57,640
 Where do you go son? 

1280
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:00,800
 Now it is the persecution to stand in this place. 

1281
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,080
 How about you son? 

1282
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:06,120
 Does your ear hear from your mouth? 

1283
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,660
 Unofficially, my place is clear. 

1284
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,480
 Osman's exile opened my eyes. 

1285
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,860
 You must halal your mother. 

1286
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:30,680
 Leave! 

1287
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:34,880
 No matter what the hell goes. 

1288
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:38,320
 Will you let him go, Dundar Bey. 

1289
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:41,020
 If we are going to pour the calalat in us ... 

1290
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,120
 First of all, we will start this from our children. 

1291
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,420
 No longer... 

1292
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,840
 I do not have a child called Batur. 

1293
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,440
 Your son is gone Dundar Bey ... 

1294
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,460
 Your son! 

1295
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:58,240
 I don't have a son called Batur anymore. 

1296
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,260
 Saltuk. 

1297
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,240
 Thank you, sir. 

1298
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:11,300
 Let me know my son Bahadır ... 

1299
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,160
 I forgive him. 

1300
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:16,100
 Back to her oba, in these difficult days ... 

1301
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:17,700
 Have it with me. 

1302
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:20,660
 This is yours, sir. 

1303
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:27,180
 Among all your troubles ... 

1304
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:30,640
 And you wrap our troubles in Bahadır Dündar Bey? 

1305
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:40,420
 With my son you ... 

1306
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:41,660
 Just me... 

1307
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:44,480
 You destroyed all my reputation. 

1308
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:49,480
 To the day I trust you and send your mother and Bahadır ... 

1309
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:51,640
 Damn it. 

1310
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:03,700
 Our obsession is now ... 

1311
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:06,180
 He is not affiliated with Dündar Bey who bowed to Balgay. 

1312
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,440
 It protects the reputation of the apricots ... 

1313
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:13,180
 It is up to us to narrow the homeland to the Mongol shroud. 

1314
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:19,000
 If we had a head as long as our hair, sacrifice the right to a lawsuit. 

1315
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:22,500
 What about Osman? Your soul was friendly. 

1316
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:28,200
 Our paths are separated with Osman Bey. 

1317
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,920
 From now on we will walk alone on this road. 

1318
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:47,300
 Is there any destruction, Samsa Bey? 

1319
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:26,060
 We have no words to speak, hiding a secret from his comrade Osman. 

1320
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:34,180
 It's a secret ... 

1321
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:37,560
 Samsa Sergeant brought us to our liberty. 

1322
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:43,000
 We became a cargo animal to the commander of the Mongolian. 

1323
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:46,980
 And even to say where you found it ... 

1324
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,700
 You came up with the Cengiz law that you did not patronize. 

1325
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:54,060
 Now you want a diet because I gave your liberty? 

1326
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:57,640
 My secret is my secret, Samsa Sergeant. 

1327
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,740
 There is no beyond. 

1328
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,400
 Your secret secret? 

1329
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:13,140
 Are there any other secrets you've kept? 

1330
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,380
 Say, well. 

1331
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:19,900
 Is it like this? 

1332
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:23,500
 Now how can I trust you and shoulder? 

1333
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,960
 How could I send my alps in front of you? 

1334
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:32,300
 From where the secret comes ... 

1335
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:34,540
 Trust it, Osman Bey. 

1336
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:37,120
 You go forward, Samsa Sergeant. 

1337
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:39,540
 You are the hero Osman Bey ... 

1338
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:42,140
 You are great Osman Bey ... 

1339
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:44,660
 Yiğitsin Osman Bey ... 

1340
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:46,860
 But your toys are Osman Bey. 

1341
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:52,880
 Come on, Samsa Sergeant! 

1342
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:53,920
 Toysun toy! 

1343
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:57,100
 We became companions to you ... 

1344
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,560
 Sense the size and ... 

1345
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:01,120
 You're cruel to us. 

1346
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:03,720
 You have no business in this oba, toy Osman. 

1347
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:49,140
 There will be no such comrades, Osman! 

1348
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:54,200
 Let me put it, hello. 

1349
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:56,520
 Shall we go in? 

1350
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:59,420
 Wait, you cannot enter between two fires. 

1351
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:01,800
 Either our head burns or our feet. 

1352
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,520
 Wait. 

1353
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:20,580
 Is that your power, Samsa Sergeant? 

1354
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:48,540
 You wouldn't do this to me. 

1355
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:51,800
 On the smallest issue ... 

1356
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:55,760
 The state cannot be established with the revolting and fleeing. 

1357
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:59,120
 If I give you the opportunity ... 

1358
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,200
 Everyone tries to upset me. 

1359
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:04,380
 You wouldn't stand up to me. 

1360
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:06,640
 No longer... 

1361
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,320
 You exhausted my patience.

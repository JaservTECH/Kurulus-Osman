1
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,220
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

2
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,575
 Since they took Osman captive ... 

3
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,005
 ... they want information. 

4
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:27,565
 They think they will reach the treasure through it 

5
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,225
 Sir. 

6
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:31,775
 What is your order? 

7
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,345
 You will go to the castle as a messenger. 

8
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:35,265
 Say to them ... 

9
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:38,655
 ... will give literary treasures. 

10
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,835
 Not that... 

11
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,180
 Usman ... 

12
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,520
 ... on condition of release. 

13
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
 Sir... 

14
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,875
 ... we struggled so many years to get them. 

15
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:55,285
 We martyred all our wounds. 

16
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,400
 Is it worth for a Osman? 

17
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,240
 We have taken back the reputation of Islam from them ... 

18
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,625
 ... Uncle dervish. 

19
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,080
 But Osman, at least ... 

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,040
 ... as valuable as the treasure. 

21
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,675
 Well, will we really give the treasure, sir? 

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,160
 If we are going to take Osman, yes. 

23
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,900
 I will be waiting for Yannis. 

24
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:19,685
 Let's come with you, Dad. 

25
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:21,365
 You... 

26
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,865
 ... come to Kayi Oba, Bala. 

27
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:27,665
 If there is an important development there, let us know. 

28
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,855
 A breath of the devil is in the oba. 

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,760
 If necessary, cut that breath away. 

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,140
 Your order is on me, my father. 

31
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:38,965
 Where do you go? 

32
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,335
 We came from the ground ... 

33
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,445
 ... we'll go to the ground, girl. 

34
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,195
 Come on, let us be blessed. 

35
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,875
 Shoot ... 

36
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:17,735
 ... instead of blood ... 

37
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:19,625
 ... you gush life. 

38
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,660
 Hope you gush. 

39
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,540
 Hit! 

40
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,980
 Hit! 

41
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
 Talk! 

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,880
 Where's the literary? 

43
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:37,595
 If you don't speak, your alps too ... 

44
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:40,785
 ... I will take your heart off with my hands. 

45
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:46,735
 Talk! 

46
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:49,295
 Talk! 

47
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,795
 Come closer. 

48
00:04:58,145 --> 00:04:59,505
 Come closer. 

49
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:12,595
 SHE IS... 

50
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:15,555
 ... where you want to disassemble. 

51
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,245
 My heart. 

52
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:21,245
 And even ... 

53
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,665
 ... in the hearts of all Turks. 

54
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:27,395
 If your strength is enough ... 

55
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,495
 ... take it off. 

56
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:54,785
 [Knife sound] 

57
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,285
 Satan! 

58
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,085
 Come! 

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
 Boğaç. 

60
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,300
 No. 

61
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,980
 Boğaç! 

62
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,480
 My brother! 

63
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,400
 Boğaç! 

64
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,755
 My brother! 

65
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,005
 Bey. 

66
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,035
 Boğaç! 

67
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,415
 I feel like a weak groan, Osman. 

68
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,500
 Do you hear 

69
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,820
 Lions roar Sofia. It does not moans. 

70
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,140
 Our dungeon ... 

71
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,440
 Osman, full of bones of decaying lions. 

72
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,460
 Hang on, brother! 

73
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,580
 Hang on! No swearing! 

74
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
 Come on, God! 

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
 Boğaç! 

76
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 My God... 

77
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,355
 ... He says in the Baccarat: 

78
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:42,155
 ''Or... 

79
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:47,245
 ... without encountering the ones before you ... 

80
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,980
 Did you think you could enter paradise? '' 

81
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,740
 Allahu Akbar. 

82
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,680
 Allahu Akbar. 

83
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,320
 Allahu Akbar. 

84
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,760
 Allahu Akbar. 

85
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,380
 Allahu Akbar. 

86
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,380
 Allahu Akbar. 

87
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
 Allahu Akbar. 

88
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,500
 Allahu Akbar. 

89
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,620
 Ornamental! 

90
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,940
 Allahu Akbar. 

91
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,660
 Allahu Akbar. 

92
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,580
 Silence those dogs. 

93
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,720
 Allahu Akbar. 

94
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
 Allahu Akbar. 

95
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,740
 Allahu Akbar. 

96
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,980
 Allahu Akbar. 

97
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,440
 Allahu Akbar. 

98
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
 Allahu Akbar. 

99
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,940
 (Applauds) 

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,580
 Request... 

101
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,075
 ... picture of my perfect victory. 

102
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:41,795
 Mr. Dundar ... 

103
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,660
 ... those who do this job are obvious. 

104
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,100
 Now you command. The alps of the beech .... 

105
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,280
 ... keep Kulucahisar castle narrow. 

106
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,020
 Where do you take Kulucahisar from, Mr. Bamsı? 

107
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,520
 Sofia and Kalanos came to our obesity. 

108
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,600
 they want friendship. 

109
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,160
 We do not even know who did this treason. 

110
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,280
 O Suleyman Shah's quarters! 

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,640
 Who are your posts? 

112
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,800
 Those who can not separate the friend and the enemy sit on their hide. 

113
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 I will cry that demon ... 

114
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,820
 ... I saw it with the dust of my feet. 

115
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,395
 How can you not see the real face of Sofia? 

116
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:23,595
 This is the song you pierce your tent ... 

117
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,960
 Unlike .... Selcan hatun. 

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,740
 The balance of this tip is sensitive ... 

119
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,205
 his politics is deep. 

120
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,535
 If you hadn't run away with your husband before ... 

121
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,935
 ... you were your waistline. 

122
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,215
 Mind the mind, smear the language. 

123
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,995
 Regardless of its diameter ... 

124
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,655
 ... tries to teach us politics. 

125
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:51,685
 Your age has passed ... 

126
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,680
 ... Selcan hatun. 

127
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,720
 Ha... 

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,420
 If you try to get involved in our works ... 

129
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,460
 ... just know that I'm not cocky. 

130
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,460
 Look at it, Bamsi ... 

131
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,000
 ... thinks the sultan who saw his strut. 

132
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,320
 Don't make me crazy and make yourself alms. 

133
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,720
 Let yourself come to Zöhre! 

134
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,700
 Shut up! 

135
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,540
 Selcan hatun. 

136
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,560
 Selcan hatun. 

137
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,875
 Selcan hatun. 

138
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:20,065
 Selcan hatun. 

139
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:21,665
 Selcan hatun. 

140
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,440
 One of you in my assembly again ... 

141
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,160
 ... if it gets longer 

142
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,180
 ... I cut your tongue. 

143
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 Now... 

144
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,565
 Er square ... 

145
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:42,635
 ... let them leave. 

146
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:44,595
 Look at your job. 

147
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,195
 Babes! 

148
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:47,845
 Out! 

149
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,200
 Mr. Dundar ... 

150
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,860
 I said out! 

151
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,240
 Mr. Dundar ... 

152
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:05,345
 ... obviously there were those who forgot the wrath of beech at the tip. 

153
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:07,075
 Thesis, let's report their terms. 

154
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,235
 Osman... 

155
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,965
 Osman is my child. 

156
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,425
 Until I find him ... 

157
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:25,755
 ... sleeping on our back, sleeping on our eyes is forbidden. 

158
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:27,485
 Not that,... 

159
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:31,055
 ... the game is bigger than I thought. 

160
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,240
 Usman ... 

161
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,840
 ... to save him from the well ... 

162
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,180
 we will ambush like a wolf, 

163
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,800
 we will roar like a lion, 

164
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:42,995
 like a fox 

165
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,495
 ... we'll be cunning. 

166
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:53,775
 Now... 

167
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,995
 .. listen to me well. 

168
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,345
 (Laughs) 

169
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,420
 Great devil ... 

170
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,600
 ...Welcome. 

171
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,440
 You pour in order. 

172
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,600
 Our greatest pleasure ... 

173
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,875
 Osman to make you suffer. 

174
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,275
 We acted out the pain, 

175
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,005
 ... we became frustrated. 

176
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,600
 Don't be excited, Osman. 

177
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,400
 We have more time. 

178
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,695
 Your quotations ... 

179
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:32,705
 ... we will listen for a long time, Osman. 

180
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,595
 Princess Sofia,.. 

181
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,655
 well done my beautiful girl 

182
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,105
 The Turks will not be comfortable, ... 

183
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:45,875
 ... they will look for Osman's trail in the castle. 

184
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,255
 They keep on knowing you angel. 

185
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,535
 Don't worry, sir. 

186
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,505
 Come easy, Osman. 

187
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,060
 (Laughs) 

188
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:26,835
 Mr. Gündüz ... 

189
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,880
 ... we can't throw the claims into the wild. 

190
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,080
 You.. 

191
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
 ... go to the castle with Mr. Bamsi ... 

192
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
 ... talk to Sofia. 

193
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
 My anger ... 

194
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,840
 make them feel. 

195
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,755
 Say ... 

196
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:49,535
 ... in the incident of Osman's ambush ... 

197
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,800
 ... if our friends have a finger ... 

198
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
 ... he cuts the finger, ... 

199
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,165
 ... we take out your lungs. 

200
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,765
 This is yours, sir. 

201
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,485
 May you exist, Dündar bey. 

202
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:08,315
 I wasn't done with that red nail anyway. 

203
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,195
 You go for the salvation of Osman, Bamsı. 

204
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,805
 Do not forget you. 

205
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,565
 both, we ... 

206
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,065
 ... no account is left unfinished. 

207
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:21,915
 Batu ... 

208
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,505
 ... all around ... 

209
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,220
 ... where there is no place where their alps do not stand. 

210
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,700
 Your eye is sharp, ... 

211
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,615
 ... your ear is the hole. 

212
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,560
 Let them be everywhere. 

213
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,480
 A trail, ... 

214
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,960
 ... if they find a man ... 

215
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,180
 ... let us know. 

216
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:43,525
 Sacrifice your life, my father. 

217
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:49,055
 I was waiting for you smarter. 

218
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,520
 Just in your first fight ... 

219
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,280
 ... you fell into my net, Osman. 

220
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,060
 You celebrate your victory early, Yannis. 

221
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,020
 Our struggle is just beginning. 

222
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,695
 Thank goodness to my Lord ... 

223
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:05,415
 ... a demon like you made me an enemy. 

224
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,300
 Did you learn from your father? 

225
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,740
 ... fierce Osman. 

226
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,600
 You want to know where Sheikh Edebali is, right? 

227
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,840
 Selling it to you, 

228
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,875
 you want to find out where the treasures are. 

229
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,445
 As a matter of fact... 

230
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:30,185
 I don't even care about your treasures. 

231
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,505
 My problem... 

232
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,365
 ... destroy your reputation. 

233
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,700
 The precious of a nation ... 

234
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,160
 ... if you take it ... 

235
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:45,625
 ... you will receive your honor and honor. 

236
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:49,515
 Or I have one of those treasures ... 

237
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:51,345
 ... so much. 

238
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,485
 Maybe you can take our treasure ... 

239
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:58,385
 ...not that,... 

240
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:00,685
 ... our soul never! 

241
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,185
 The province goes ... 

242
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:07,055
 our ancestors said ... 

243
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:08,885
 We... 

244
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:10,585
 ... honor our ... 

245
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,775
 ... we riveted our hearts and minds. 

246
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:17,765
 Even if there is only one Turk left on the earth ... 

247
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:20,935
 ... our state means that our ceremony is alive. 

248
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:24,775
 He is also the purpose of a single Turk, your ... 

249
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,005
 is to demolish the pharaohs. 

250
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:53,095
 Come on, Osman. 

251
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,275
 you're thirsty. 

252
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,560
 You are very angry, novice Osman. 

253
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,920
 Very. 

254
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:40,955
 Is it ready? 

255
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,055
 (Sword sound) 

256
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,520
 Oh, fire. 

257
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,400
 Iron mountains ... 

258
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,760
 ... the melting fire. 

259
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:17,195
 Show your strength! 

260
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,020
 (Laughs) 

261
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
 (Sighs) 

262
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,420
 Demon! 

263
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,960
 Bastard! 

264
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,420
 Demon melu. 

265
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
 What good friends you have, Osman. 

266
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,380
 As you hurt ... 

267
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:53,655
 ... they are shouting. 

268
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:59,955
 Is this the sword of your fire, Yannis? 

269
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,160
 Now, witness my victory, Osman. 

270
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
 Negal to! 

271
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,400
 Where's the literary? 

272
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
 Where is Literary? 

273
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,780
 God! 

274
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,440
 In the name of Allah, the most gracious and womb. 

275
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,540
 '' Certainly, we have given you a clear conquest. 

276
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,315
 That Allah .. 

277
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,280
 ... forgive your past and future sins, 

278
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,840
 ... complete your blessing to you, ... 

279
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,380
 ... get you on the right path ... 

280
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:31,935
 ... and Allah for you ... 

281
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,855
 ... help with a glorious victory. '' 

282
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:36,755
 SHE IS,... 

283
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:38,775
 ... the beliefs of the believers ... 

284
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,115
 ... for incrementally ... 

285
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:42,465
 ... hearts ... 

286
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:44,525
 ... gives peace and security. 

287
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:47,895
 Armies of heaven and earth are God's. 

288
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:50,095
 God... 

289
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:51,675
 ... who knows it properly. 

290
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:53,725
 Judgment and ... 

291
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:54,735
 ... has wisdom. 

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Allahu Akbar! 

293
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
 Enough! 

294
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,920
 Enough! 

295
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,940
 I will tell the place of Edebali. 

296
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,020
 I am listening to you, smart Osman. 

297
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,495
 Where's the literary? 

298
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,900
 Master Yannis. 

299
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,780
 Come on, God! 

300
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,860
 Come on, God! 

301
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,880
 Only God! 

302
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,100
 Genetic dogs! 

303
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
 God! 

304
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,940
 Sir... 

305
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,240
 Master Yannis! 

306
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,840
 Is there any news from Osman Bey, Batur? 

307
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,420
 Aren't you the cousin? You couldn't take care of a brain. 

308
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:47,155
 When you kneel at the enemy with your grudge ... 

309
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:50,505
 ... traitors inside us hit us. 

310
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,025
 I hope you have not betrayed again. 

311
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:58,105
 Otherwise, this time I don't feed your head to dogs. 

312
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,620
 You can't take care of your brain, but here ... 

313
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,240
 Sama! 

314
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,695
 If you were so brave, while Osman was kidnapped ... 

315
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,345
 ... what the hell would you do when martyrs died? 

316
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:15,035
 You are fever fever, Batur. 

317
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:17,595
 But I have a word for Bamsı. 

318
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,420
 Until I kneel at the enemy, so that I will not carry wood to the mischief. 

319
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,240
 If I hear another treason ... 

320
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,980
 ... if the sentence comes, I can not get rid of my neck from my tooth, you know. 

321
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:32,665
 You've long, Samsa, long. 

322
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:35,525
 You are going to the apricot now ... 

323
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,695
 ... allegiance to my father Dundar. 

324
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:43,585
 Our Ertuğrul Bey gave power of attorney to my father. 

325
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:06,255
 God you're great. 

326
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,940
 You are great, my God. 

327
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,100
 What do I owe this visit to? 

328
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,835
 We didn't come for a visit, Sofia. 

329
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,605
 We came to ask for an account. 

330
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,165
 An attack, maybe a betrayal. 

331
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:36,165
 You will tell us this. 

332
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,345
 I don't understand anything from what you say. 

333
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:44,235
 What betrayal, what attack? 

334
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:47,065
 Osman bey and his alps were attacked. 

335
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,440
 There is no need to extend the word. 

336
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,000
 If there is Kulucahisar at the end of this melady ... 

337
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,220
 ... fear our wrath. 

338
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,320
 On our land, ... 

339
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,895
 ... you are threatening us in our pen, Mr. Gündüz. 

340
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:03,455
 We don't threaten, Kalanos! 

341
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:11,605
 Süleyman Shah's son Dundar is the command of the brain .... 

342
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:15,225
 ... If it hurt our Alps, 

343
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:17,055
 ... who mean our gentlemen ... 

344
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,920
 ... if you are the ones who take care of our health ... 

345
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,600
 ... the wrath of the beech will be on you ... 

346
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,500
 ... You know. 

347
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,160
 God ... 

348
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,060
 ... upon our faith in our patience ... 

349
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,460
 ... we arrive at your door with our horses with lightning from their hooves. 

350
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:37,395
 It washes your door with our iron fists .... 

351
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:44,375
 ... we make tombstones from your zodiac signs. 

352
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,440
 We do it, Sofia. 

353
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,000
 We do billahi. 

354
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,855
 I understand your pain, Mr. Bamsı. 

355
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:12,605
 We are your strongest ally. 

356
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,745
 Why should we do something like this? 

357
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:19,595
 We killed the traitor Yannis inside us. 

358
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:23,285
 Just because our friend is getting stronger. 

359
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:31,695
 I lost my husband to make this peace. 

360
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:33,715
 That's why,... 

361
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:36,735
 ... whoever prevents this peace from breaking ... 

362
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:39,475
 ... I kill with my own hands. 

363
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:46,505
 Commander Kalanos! 

364
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,920
 It is my command to all soldiers in Kulucahisar fortress. 

365
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,180
 Our strong ally ... 

366
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,700
 Osman Bey, one of the lords of Kayı Obasi, 

367
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,760
 ... will be searched everywhere. 

368
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,115
 It hurts him ... 

369
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,080
 ... everything will be destroyed. 

370
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,980
 Until we get news from him .... 

371
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,980
 ... the movement will not end. 

372
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,340
 Yes, sir. 

373
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,875
 Now stop your doubts about us ... 

374
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,860
 ... Mr. Gunduz. 

375
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,480
 As long as we keep the peace, everyone will win. 

376
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:25,505
 Thank you. 

377
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:27,995
 Princess Sofia. 

378
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:29,645
 Thank you. 

379
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:32,305
 Sofia ... 

380
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:37,205
 ... these eyes are there ... 

381
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:38,805
 ... these eyes ... 

382
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,320
 ... dressed in lamb skin, and saw many foxes. 

383
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,660
 Finally, the hides of those foxes ... 

384
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,960
 ... this has been sacked. 

385
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:58,835
 Even if you ... 

386
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,735
 ...Princess Sofia. 

387
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:05,735
 Come on, I'm Gunduz. 

388
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:09,725
 Let's be informal. 

389
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,685
 Thank you, Mr. Bamsi. 

390
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:38,655
 Sir, sir are you okay? 

391
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,005
 He even endured a lot. 

392
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,780
 As strong as a tiger. 

393
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,720
 He will not speak easily. 

394
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:24,715
 When it comes to you ... 

395
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:26,725
 ... continue to torture. 

396
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,480
 Where are you, sir? 

397
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,560
 Fortress. 

398
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,480
 Literary will reach me for Osman. 

399
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,765
 Don't let the men take the precaution. 

400
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,385
 Yes, sir. 

401
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,625
 Kayi on ... 

402
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:44,395
 ... smells blood quickly. 

403
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,960
 That's the traitor Mark! 

404
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
 Going. 

405
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,260
 Why did he come? 

406
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,840
 What was he doing here? 

407
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,180
 Which face did you come here! 

408
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,180
 What are you doing here Traitor! 

409
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,320
 Pastor Mark! 

410
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,025
 Traitor! 

411
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,340
 What are you doing here? There is a traitor, traitor. 

412
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,840
 What face do you come here? 

413
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,380
 Kill the traitor! 

414
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:45,595
 Kill it! 

415
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,235
 Tursun Fakı! 

416
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,080
 Soldiers! 

417
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,740
 Get it! 

418
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,745
 (Sword sound) 

419
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:16,085
 If you act, it will die. 

420
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,415
 You will take me to Sofia. 

421
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:22,355
 I brought the greetings of Edebali. 

422
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,955
 Take meat, eat meat. 

423
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:47,685
 Slow coyote, slow. 

424
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:50,585
 You shouldn't die, you need me more. 

425
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,080
 Why do you do that? 

426
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:10,965
 What do you want from me? 

427
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:14,075
 Although our parties are separate, ... 

428
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:16,265
 ... our enemies are the same. 

429
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:19,275
 Osman. 

430
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:35,505
 Listen to me carefully. 

431
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
 This was Osman's trouble. 

432
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
 ... a bigger trouble. 

433
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,620
 Tell me where Osman is. 

434
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,095
 I have to protect my father's reputation. 

435
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:04,105
 Banane is from your father's reputation. 

436
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:07,465
 I can't tell you where Osman is. 

437
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:11,505
 From you... 

438
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:15,385
 ... not Osman's life, 

439
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,615
 I want your dead. 

440
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,140
 Osman,... 

441
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,260
 ... an obstacle to my dreams. 

442
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:33,485
 We go to the time, become the head of the hunt. 

443
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,780
 Toykur becomes a halay. 

444
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,680
 Always, the most majestic Osman, the mighty Osman. 

445
00:34:40,155 --> 00:34:41,155
 Me too... 

446
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:43,095
 I've always been left behind. 

447
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:46,025
 Without going over it ... 

448
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,780
 ... I will not open up. 

449
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,440
 Or ... 

450
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,600
 ... I make a hole in your throat ... 

451
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,315
 ... or ... 

452
00:34:55,815 --> 00:34:58,635
 ... I'll give you the gold in her lap. 

453
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,705
 Nothing much to think about. 

454
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,925
 You want me's head of Osman. 

455
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,820
 You just need to talk about gold. 

456
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,100
 I would even kill my father. 

457
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,400
 I'll be waiting at the edge of the stream. 

458
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,500
 Bring Osman's head to me until evening. 

459
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,340
 Not that,... 

460
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,440
 ... no gold without seeing the head, you know. 

461
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,295
 It was a good deal. 

462
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,975
 It was a good deal. 

463
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:29,815
 Nobody? 

464
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:34,955
 Nobody? 

465
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:41,115
 Nobody? 

466
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,820
 You exist, son. 

467
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,660
 Edebali! 

468
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,740
 Who more do you need? 

469
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,375
 Edebali! 

470
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:54,205
 Where are you? 

471
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,220
 The creatures called human beings love ... 

472
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,720
 son in your heart 

473
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:01,265
 Don't call me elsewhere. 

474
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:09,835
 Thank god. 

475
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,625
 Thank god. 

476
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:15,605
 Edebali. 

477
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:20,735
 Our hands tied my arm. 

478
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:22,715
 I'm desperate. 

479
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:28,195
 I have no strength. 

480
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:40,305
 Those who find true freedom in servitude to Allah ... 

481
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,820
 ... they'll never be captured, son. 

482
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,960
 Why is all this reason? 

483
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,300
 How do I get rid of this curse? 

484
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,325
 Cure,... 

485
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,825
 ... is in trouble. 

486
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,165
 You will see. 

487
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:13,345
 Here, son. 

488
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:19,445
 Get. 

489
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,235
 Get. 

490
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:23,185
 Separate dirt from mud. 

491
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:25,485
 Separate ... 

492
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:27,785
 ... learn to separate. 

493
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:29,835
 Find out ... 

494
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,415
 ... increase your knowledge. 

495
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:35,635
 The real treasure ... 

496
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:38,145
 ... is science, Osmancik. 

497
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:39,515
 Treasures ... 

498
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,140
 but it is obvious to those who know how to see. 

499
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,600
 Seeing everything, ... 

500
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:48,255
 ... hear ... 

501
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:50,535
 God knows. 

502
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,725
 Do you think he forgot you? 

503
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,560
 His servant came, do you think he tied you? 

504
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,580
 Free your suspects, son. 

505
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:07,215
 Separate dirt, ... 

506
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,240
 ... to the treasure. 

507
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,240
 Fe inne meal ... 

508
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,500
 ... usri yüsra. 

509
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,520
 Fe inne meal ... 

510
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,120
 ... usri yüsra. 

511
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,205
 Fe inne ... 

512
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:27,895
 ... meal ... 

513
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,840
 ... usri yüsra. 

514
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,060
 Fe inne meal ... 

515
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,600
 ... usri yüsra. 

516
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
 Fe inne meal ... 

517
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,220
 ... usri yüsra. 

518
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,880
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

519
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,840
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

520
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,480
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

521
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,720
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

522
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,080
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

523
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,820
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

524
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:29,495
 Honey chick! 

525
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,385
 Be slow. 

526
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:40,305
 Your speed competes with your cheek. 

527
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,825
 If you put it through the door, you enter through the chimney. 

528
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:46,185
 What is this stupidity? 

529
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,180
 You do not know the ceremony as you do not know the limit. 

530
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,640
 When was the guest arriving at the Turkish ceremony fired? 

531
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:55,865
 I know what to say ... 

532
00:42:56,345 --> 00:42:58,955
 ... you don't know where to stop. 

533
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:02,725
 You came with your sinister feet ... 

534
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:04,445
 ... you're in trouble. 

535
00:43:04,855 --> 00:43:07,335
 Osman will die from your face! 

536
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,715
 How much more blood do you want? 

537
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:11,865
 Not enough? 

538
00:43:12,275 --> 00:43:15,325
 When you are in trouble, do you cry like that? 

539
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:18,615
 As if you grew up in the palace, not in the oba. 

540
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:22,765
 Aygül bacı, since you have big dreams ... 

541
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:24,945
 ... then keep your heart big. 

542
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:28,135
 Don't fall like this in every fight 

543
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:35,185
 If that hand is up to me again ... 

544
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:36,935
 ... I will scrape your eyes. 

545
00:43:39,205 --> 00:43:40,325
 Babes! 

546
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:45,235
 Aygul! 

547
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:51,375
 What is going on in the middle of such a hall? 

548
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,400
 Trouble falls on us like rain, Selcan aunt. 

549
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,080
 Because of these. 

550
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,600
 Now, without shame and boredom ... 

551
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,500
 ... they came to our door. 

552
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:04,565
 Bala. 

553
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:06,865
 Go late, girl. 

554
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,540
 Come on to your business! 

555
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,580
 Lets! 

556
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,700
 Aygul. 

557
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:26,345
 You forget, I will remind you. 

558
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,260
 You're a gentleman. 

559
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,560
 Your biggest ornament, literary. This is a. 

560
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,940
 Osman showed his life for Bala chick. 

561
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,580
 Nobody, including you, can get in between ... 

562
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,860
 ... this is two. 

563
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:47,255
 Earn these in your ear. 

564
00:44:49,575 --> 00:44:51,585
 Don't push my patience too much. 

565
00:44:52,365 --> 00:44:53,635
 This is three. 

566
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:17,435
 What is this, Andreas? 

567
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,640
 To my presence with a priest breakdown ... 

568
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,420
 ... what's it like? 

569
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,060
 HE? 

570
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,360
 Take it easy, Sofia. 

571
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,940
 Your old friend came to visit you. 

572
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,260
 What's going to get angry with that? 

573
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,240
 Soldiers! 

574
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,240
 If you take one step further, Andreas will die. 

575
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,120
 I brought Edebali's offer. 

576
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:51,635
 Master Yannis was right again. 

577
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,780
 Pastor Markos, ... 

578
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,500
 ... you came with your own feet. 

579
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,855
 You will bring it to the treasure. 

580
00:46:08,675 --> 00:46:09,935
 I am listening to you. 

581
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,260
 Until Yannis came ... 

582
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,980
 ... there is no single sentence. 

583
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,300
 I'll wait for him here. 

584
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:23,075
 I hope I won't bother you. 

585
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,880
 Is there any news from Osman Bey? 

586
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,540
 None. 

587
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,540
 No news ... 

588
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:38,455
 ... but they come out under the head of that red demon ... 

589
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:39,455
 ...I know. 

590
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:43,795
 Kulucahisar demons play us. 

591
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:49,645
 They do not know that the issue is not an account, it is a grant. 

592
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:53,875
 You have to knock down that castle. 

593
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,325
 Let Osman Bey return ... 

594
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,195
 ... it will be next time. 

595
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:01,285
 I Uthman ... 

596
00:47:01,825 --> 00:47:04,345
 ... that's how God knows. 

597
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,440
 Osman is the fortune of our obese. 

598
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,640
 May my Lord bless him. 

599
00:47:14,905 --> 00:47:18,035
 My father sent me here when Osman got the brain news. 

600
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,680
 Do they have a wish? 

601
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,680
 He wants to support. 

602
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,740
 God bless you. 

603
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:32,435
 Ah! 

604
00:47:50,545 --> 00:47:52,745
 You threw the conversation. 

605
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,940
 Do not mention the informal gentleman in this place. 

606
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,340
 Did you get unwanted in the binary output? 

607
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,600
 Fe inne meal ... 

608
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,420
 ... usri yüsra. 

609
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,300
 Fe inne meal usri yüsra. 

610
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,020
 Fe inne meal ... 

611
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,520
 ... usri yüsra. 

612
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,940
 Thank God, 

613
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,180
 Thank god. 

614
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,960
 Lord! 

615
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,080
 It is the first time that I see the lion who loves beating. 

616
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,860
 And see your claw. 

617
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,860
 Because Dundar became a proxy for the brain ... 

618
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,420
 ... your lice got blood? 

619
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,620
 Sir, sir ... 

620
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:05,355
 ... I am informal, I am the chick of the apricot. 

621
00:51:09,295 --> 00:51:11,305
 If the syriad is floating ... 

622
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:14,075
 ... I bring it in line, insha'Allah. 

623
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,020
 There is no need for anyone. 

624
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:18,900
 Good. 

625
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,960
 You will start with your daughter first then. 

626
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,860
 The chick of the plane. 

627
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,195
 Dundar brain neither Edebali nor daughter ... 

628
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,715
 ... he doesn't want it. 

629
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:42,695
 Whatever Mr. Bey says. 

630
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,435
 There is no beyond. 

631
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,485
 Woe, woe, woe. 

632
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,720
 When did you grow up enough to teach me the ceremony, Zöhre? 

633
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,585
 Teaching the ceremony to Selcan of the years ... 

634
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,515
 ... if it is up to you ... 

635
00:52:02,525 --> 00:52:04,525
 ... wow that ceremony. 

636
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,120
 We... 

637
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,820
 You? 

638
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,100
 The maid of being naughty ... 

639
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,620
 ... you mixed it up beautiful girl. 

640
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:20,625
 Now with your mom ... 

641
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:23,665
 ... think about what you've been doing all this time. 

642
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:24,965
 Think about... 

643
00:52:24,965 --> 00:52:27,975
 ... Selcan hatun what a patient, understand. 

644
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:30,935
 As for Bala's line ... 

645
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,495
 ... is my guest. 

646
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:39,065
 It has a place above my head. 

647
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,380
 Not an informal lady, but ... 

648
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
 ... let the brain come ... 

649
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,800
 ... can't touch my guest without breaking my corpse. 

650
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,040
 You know that. 

651
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,520
 Not enough? 

652
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,860
 This is how you convey it to your brain. 

653
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,080
 As you said, chick. 

654
00:53:02,895 --> 00:53:05,735
 Whatever one does will make it to himself. 

655
00:53:05,735 --> 00:53:09,185
 Inform yourself, you know what happens next. 

656
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:11,565
 Zöhre ... 

657
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,440
 I have two feet ... 

658
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,440
 ... with your daughter ... 

659
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,715
 ... without taking those two feet under my feet ... 

660
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,600
 ... go to your tent. 

661
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,600
 Don't boil my water. 

662
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,180
 While you have to go with your man, with your literature ... 

663
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,820
 ... don't put yourself in front of the door. 

664
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,900
 Lets! 

665
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,980
 Come on quickly! 

666
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,960
 Lets! 

667
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,120
 Hey! 

668
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,040
 What is going on there? 

669
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,900
 Pastor Markos. 

670
00:55:02,205 --> 00:55:05,025
 To see you here again ... 

671
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:06,275
 how beautiful. 

672
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,975
 As long as you stay in this land ... 

673
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:13,625
 ... you will see us every day. 

674
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,280
 Where is the treasure? 

675
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,280
 The object you call the treasure .... 

676
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,340
 Yannis is in the heart of everybody. 

677
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,920
 No wonder you searched so much. 

678
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:41,265
 Does the literary want Osman, 

679
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:42,685
 ...does not he want it? 

680
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,520
 Sir, he said he would give you what you wanted. 

681
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,040
 Where's the literary? 

682
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:51,315
 You... 

683
00:55:52,205 --> 00:55:54,865
 ... is waiting around Akçadede. 

684
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:57,455
 Not that,... 

685
00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:01,585
 ... if Osman does not see the right man ... 

686
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,760
 ... sir will not bring the treasure. 

687
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,920
 Nekal to! 

688
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,880
 Bring Osman to the place he says. 

689
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,900
 I will be waiting for you there. 

690
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,100
 If this is a trap ... 

691
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,980
 ... in Usman, ... 

692
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,460
 ... will die in Edebali. 

693
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,000
 Finally, you fell into my hand, Osman. 

694
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,280
 You trapped us. 

695
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,680
 Dog! 

696
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,020
 Like the canteen you put on my head as hangman ... 

697
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,100
 ... I'm gonna kill. 

698
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,600
 Kanturalı! 

699
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,560
 The teeth of the dogs like you do not pass to Kanturalı. 

700
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,140
 Dundar is the son of a brain man, Batur, 

701
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,760
 ... wants your head. 

702
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,340
 Batur? 

703
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,880
 Not only you... 

704
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,740
 even the dogs around him are afraid of me. 

705
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,540
 I see it in your eyes. 

706
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,540
 Your death will be so much fun. 

707
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,960
 I ate, uncle's son! 

708
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
 Die! 

709
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
 Batur. 

710
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,940
 Ah! 

711
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,140
 Acıman! 

712
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,560
 Shoot without pain! 

713
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,780
 Lets! 

714
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,920
 Shoot without pain! 

715
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,800
 Mr. Bamsi! 

716
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,860
 Come on, God! 

717
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,140
 Samsa sergeant. 

718
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,120
 Come on, God! 

719
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,500
 Appreciate Allah! 

720
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,700
 Come on, God! 

721
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,420
 My brother! 

722
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,940
 Batu ... 

723
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:11,265
 ...What i say to you. 

724
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,840
 Thank God you were brought up just in time. 

725
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,840
 Thank you. 

726
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,100
 How did you find it? 

727
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,820
 Huan ... 

728
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,760
 ... fell into my trap. 

729
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,520
 Bro who brought me to you. 

730
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,300
 Forgive me. 

731
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,720
 Good job. 

732
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,580
 Thank you, Mr. Batur. 

733
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,960
 You played for the descendant of the shroud. 

734
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,680
 Brother! 

735
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:52,455
 My brother! 

736
01:00:54,155 --> 01:00:55,155
 Brother! 

737
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:01,355
 Thank god. 

738
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:12,625
 Samsa! 

739
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:41,765
 Mr. Bamsı. 

740
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,115
 Boğaç! 

741
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:56,145
 Ahvali is bad. 

742
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,720
 Osman! 

743
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,600
 Abdurrahman Gazi. 

744
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,040
 I Usman. 

745
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,840
 Thank god... 

746
01:02:49,585 --> 01:02:51,695
 Thank God my father is back. 

747
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,595
 Brother. 

748
01:03:22,855 --> 01:03:23,855
 My father? 

749
01:03:31,525 --> 01:03:33,355
 Abdurrahman Gazi. 

750
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,260
 Where is my father? 

751
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,280
 Say, where's my father? 

752
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,860
 Our father is sick, brother. 

753
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:56,835
 Non,... 

754
01:03:57,805 --> 01:03:58,955
 ... power of attorney ... 

755
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:01,235
 ... Dundar is in our uncle. 

756
01:04:37,505 --> 01:04:39,445
 Hey gone years hey. 

757
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:44,565
 Hayme is my mother's smiling face. 

758
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,365
 The full voice of Solomon Shahim. 

759
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:51,015
 The states of my Osman who are not in the palm of hand. 

760
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,420
 Ah. 

761
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,220
 Sit down, what am I going to show you. 

762
01:05:03,895 --> 01:05:05,775
 These are my Osman's. 

763
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:09,535
 This cardigan. 

764
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,940
 Tiny. 

765
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,940
 Oh, tiny. 

766
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:17,400
 He was hanged at that time, now a lion. 

767
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:20,905
 I erected the first mane of that lion ... 

768
01:05:20,905 --> 01:05:21,905
 ...I. 

769
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:26,855
 It grew and flourished. 

770
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:31,265
 He used pusat with Bamsı and Turgut bey. 

771
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:34,805
 His bravery from Allah, ... 

772
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:38,685
 ... took his skill in using pusat from his father Ertuğrul. 

773
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:45,905
 He was always at the top among the children in Oba. 

774
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:49,875
 His arrow was stuck first. 

775
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,255
 He left the first wooden pusat. 

776
01:05:54,205 --> 01:05:56,585
 Her peers also followed her. 

777
01:05:57,655 --> 01:05:59,825
 He grew up, became a gentleman. 

778
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,180
 Hunt friends as well. 

779
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,580
 Fortunately, their relationship never deteriorated. 

780
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:13,605
 Selcan hatun. 

781
01:06:15,085 --> 01:06:17,345
 There is something I wonder. 

782
01:06:17,885 --> 01:06:19,025
 Ask me, girl. 

783
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:27,495
 Ask, don't be shy. 

784
01:06:30,785 --> 01:06:32,085
 Mr. Osman... 

785
01:06:34,415 --> 01:06:37,275
 Has he ever been in love before? 

786
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:47,405
 I don't know that, girl. 

787
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,060
 But when I say Bala, I know the light that shines in her eyes. 

788
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,920
 I am Osman's mother. 

789
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,680
 I know him well. 

790
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,960
 If I mothered her, 

791
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,100
 ... you know that ... 

792
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,300
 ... Bala chick writes in the heart of Osman. 

793
01:07:08,785 --> 01:07:11,835
 It was heard from the sound of Bala that was shaking when he said chick. 

794
01:07:11,835 --> 01:07:14,365
 ... and I can see it from its shining eyes. 

795
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,060
 Just like yours. 

796
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,060
 Apparently,... 

797
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,840
 My Lord has tied your hearts together. 

798
01:07:24,535 --> 01:07:26,075
 Good luck with you. 

799
01:07:26,525 --> 01:07:27,525
 God willing. 

800
01:07:28,355 --> 01:07:29,355
 God willing. 

801
01:08:13,895 --> 01:08:14,895
 Thank God. 

802
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:18,005
 Thank god. 

803
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:47,015
 My God ... 

804
01:09:48,215 --> 01:09:50,155
 Osman forgave you. 

805
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:49,315
 May you exist, uncle. 

806
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,245
 You made my face slow ... 

807
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:04,665
 ... you bumped my chest. 

808
01:11:05,745 --> 01:11:07,345
 With the help of Allah ... 

809
01:11:08,175 --> 01:11:09,595
 ... you saved Osman. 

810
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:11,875
 Be there, son. 

811
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,180
 Exist. 

812
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,360
 Long live Batur Alp! 

813
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:27,240
 Long live Batur Alp! 

814
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:34,080
 Long live Batur Alp! 

815
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,440
 Long live Batur Alp! 

816
01:11:41,545 --> 01:11:42,635
 (Sword sound.) 

817
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:47,985
 God bless uncle son. 

818
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:52,365
 Uncle son from you. 

819
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,145
 Thank you, Mr. Dundar. 

820
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,220
 Thank goodness the troubles that stifled our hearts have been resolved. 

821
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,560
 However, we are curious. 

822
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,480
 How Batur Alp got this job done. 

823
01:12:33,685 --> 01:12:35,795
 Selcan hatun through reason. 

824
01:12:36,995 --> 01:12:38,045
 Through the mind. 

825
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:41,475
 I have the key to save Osman, my father. 

826
01:12:42,175 --> 01:12:43,175
 Both ... 

827
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,340
 ... if we save him ... 

828
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,260
 ... riveted in the beylik of Oba. 

829
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,820
 How? 

830
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,760
 The man called Hovan is in my hands. 

831
01:12:51,725 --> 01:12:53,925
 He will take us to Osman. 

832
01:12:53,925 --> 01:12:56,145
 Then press with Bamsı gentlemen. 

833
01:12:59,885 --> 01:13:01,005
 Zöhre ... 

834
01:13:01,565 --> 01:13:03,575
 ... I will take care of Osman. 

835
01:13:08,955 --> 01:13:09,955
 Aunt. 

836
01:13:14,855 --> 01:13:18,505
 Those who do this to you ... 

837
01:13:20,755 --> 01:13:21,755
 ... drown in your blood, son. 

838
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:23,745
 Osman! 

839
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,060
 When Gasp ... 

840
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,120
 Come to the room. 

841
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,780
 Thank you uncle. 

842
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,780
 Thank you. 

843
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,700
 I Uthman ... 

844
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,160
 ... Honey chick is in the middle. 

845
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,840
 What do you say, aunt? 

846
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,240
 Lets. 

847
01:13:49,565 --> 01:13:50,740
 Thanks. 

848
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,555
 The prisoners have fled! 

849
01:14:29,005 --> 01:14:30,145
 Master Yannis. 

850
01:14:33,365 --> 01:14:34,365
 We are going! 

851
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,995
 I got out of hell, 

852
01:15:09,475 --> 01:15:11,525
 I fell on the slopes. 

853
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,400
 My Lord rewarded him with his paradise .... 

854
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,660
 ... honey chick. 

855
01:15:18,585 --> 01:15:20,695
 Every moment passed by begging. 

856
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:22,565
 Thank god. 

857
01:15:22,745 --> 01:15:24,925
 It was a privilege to see you right. 

858
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:28,605
 God made me live the greatest of joys Osman. 

859
01:15:42,475 --> 01:15:44,065
 However, your condition is devastated. 

860
01:15:46,785 --> 01:15:48,235
 Let your hands break! 

861
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,945
 Let the lineage out of those who do this to you! 

862
01:15:52,235 --> 01:15:55,325
 You should be in the healing tent. 

863
01:15:55,325 --> 01:15:56,325
 Don't you know? 

864
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,280
 Your words become an ointment to my wounds. 

865
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,180
 Your eyes light up my nights. 

866
01:16:07,185 --> 01:16:08,315
 Non,... 

867
01:16:10,105 --> 01:16:11,105
 I forgot my pain. 

868
01:16:14,305 --> 01:16:15,685
 Forget it too. 

869
01:16:19,015 --> 01:16:20,015
 God,... 

870
01:16:21,685 --> 01:16:23,585
 ... with those who are patient. 

871
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,285
 Allah is with those who are patient. 

872
01:16:55,165 --> 01:16:56,765
 Where is this Literary? 

873
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,780
 Or is this a game? 

874
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,120
 Be sure, .. 

875
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,420
 Yannis is seeing you, sir. 

876
01:17:35,675 --> 01:17:36,675
 Edebali. 

877
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,145
 Soldiers! 

878
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:35,335
 The past years have been tired of you, Literary. 

879
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,180
 Where is the young I see at the foot of Ahi Evran, 

880
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,900
 ... where is the old man in front of me. 

881
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:45,755
 This depends on how you look, Yannis. 

882
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:49,835
 Young enough to fight you all the time ... 

883
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:57,295
 I'm old as if he'll die at any moment. 

884
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,740
 Apparently these clacks did not help you. 

885
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,880
 Here you are. 

886
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:12,255
 If you don't give what I want ... 

887
01:19:12,505 --> 01:19:14,295
 ... you know you'll die. 

888
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,545
 Those who perished in the right case ... 

889
01:19:17,965 --> 01:19:20,415
 ... lives more than his executioners ... 

890
01:19:20,415 --> 01:19:21,855
 ... Yannis. 

891
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:24,235
 You won't give up, are you? 

892
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,380
 The fighting spirit inside, 

893
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,760
 ... makes you a warrior like a goat. 

894
01:19:30,305 --> 01:19:33,125
 You don't even see the defeat based on the door. 

895
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:40,025
 God ordered us to fight the oppressors. 

896
01:19:40,655 --> 01:19:43,175
 Victory is both my blessing! 

897
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,540
 In our view ... 

898
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,060
 ... the head from it is about the eye. 

899
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,020
 What a pity. 

900
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,120
 You still believe that it will change the layout I set up. 

901
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,660
 Not just the order, but ... 

902
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,700
 ... we will change the age, Yannis. 

903
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:09,040
 The persecution reign of you ... 

904
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,880
 ... will fall to the ground. 

905
01:20:50,285 --> 01:20:52,035
 Huge.... 

906
01:20:53,995 --> 01:20:56,125
 ... Suleyman Shah's grandson, ... 

907
01:20:58,545 --> 01:20:59,545
 ...Osman. 

908
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,200
 To the wounds that open ... 

909
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,840
 ... take a good look. 

910
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,120
 Look ... 

911
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,900
 ... see you tomorrow. 

912
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:39,265
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

913
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,760
 Sorry, your injuries Osman. 

914
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,280
 Sorry ... 

915
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,660
 ... let your fire go. 

916
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,720
 May you burn, Mr. Osman. 

917
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,300
 Let it be ... 

918
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:52,975
 ... salute the good fortune. 

919
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,560
 To you ... 

920
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,480
 ... is your engagement. 

921
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,800
 Do not forget you. 

922
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,380
 Do not forget you. 

923
01:23:25,855 --> 01:23:27,655
 You have not changed at all. 

924
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:30,985
 Since we will wait for the Treasury and Osman ... 

925
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,840
 ... faithful to you ... 

926
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,580
 I would like to hear how you raise these guys. 

927
01:23:48,895 --> 01:23:51,965
 Hearts are in the hands of God Yannis. 

928
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,180
 In the profanity well you are in ... 

929
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,640
 ... you see this light ... 

930
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,600
 ... it's impossible to grasp the truths of this commitment. 

931
01:24:01,925 --> 01:24:03,935
 I leaked to you. 

932
01:24:04,195 --> 01:24:07,515
 His skin belongs to you and his spirit to us ... 

933
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,700
 I raised hundreds of men. 

934
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,560
 The unity consciousness of Muslims is left behind, Edebali. 

935
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,760
 You believe that you will revive that spirit. 

936
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,940
 With the gold I bought from you ... 

937
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,040
 I'm going to recruit new souls. 

938
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,940
 I will hit you with yours. 

939
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,340
 We are so brave that Yannis, ... 

940
01:24:30,735 --> 01:24:33,095
 their soul has no cost. 

941
01:24:33,795 --> 01:24:34,975
 What authority, ... 

942
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:38,255
 ... neither position nor any other world. 

943
01:24:39,165 --> 01:24:42,085
 They are filled with dhikr, 

944
01:24:42,325 --> 01:24:44,055
 ... thankfully she dresses, ... 

945
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,340
 they fight patiently. 

946
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,700
 Sure, you ... 

947
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:52,700
 You are not even aware of this because it is the toy of the devil. 

948
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,660
 Keep in mind,... 

949
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,600
 .... the previous name of the devil was Azazil. 

950
01:24:59,655 --> 01:25:01,465
 Heaven's keeper, ... 

951
01:25:01,885 --> 01:25:04,345
 ... and he was the manager of the angels. 

952
01:25:04,775 --> 01:25:06,545
 Your destiny is the same. 

953
01:25:07,425 --> 01:25:09,415
 Who also demonizes you .... 

954
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:12,695
 ... your ambition to win, your pride. 

955
01:25:13,185 --> 01:25:16,565
 If there is victory in the end, I don't care at all. 

956
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:19,395
 Alone, I wonder. 

957
01:25:20,015 --> 01:25:22,305
 Why is this Osman so important to you? 

958
01:25:25,505 --> 01:25:28,525
 Otherwise, Ahmet Yesevi's wooden sword ... 

959
01:25:28,525 --> 01:25:30,475
 ... would you consider giving it to him? 

960
01:25:30,835 --> 01:25:32,575
 Absolute fate, ... 

961
01:25:32,575 --> 01:25:34,735
 Yannis knitting his nets. 

962
01:25:34,735 --> 01:25:36,905
 The end of people like you, 

963
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:39,875
 ... will bring brave people like Osman. 

964
01:25:41,825 --> 01:25:42,825
 Osman... 

965
01:25:44,975 --> 01:25:48,135
 I am Batur, sky-eyed brave. 

966
01:25:48,305 --> 01:25:50,735
 God is always on his way ... 

967
01:25:50,735 --> 01:25:52,745
 ... make your pusat sharp. 

968
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,300
 Amen mom, be there. 

969
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:57,320
 Amine. 

970
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,320
 Oba ... 

971
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,180
 ... all balances have changed. 

972
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,335
 God for every father ... 

973
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:06,225
 ... just like a son like you, son. 

974
01:26:07,665 --> 01:26:09,495
 Sacrifice your way, my father. 

975
01:26:18,275 --> 01:26:20,965
 He sent his literary daughter to the oba. 

976
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:25,780
 Keep Osman away from Sheikh Edebali, Mr. Dundar. 

977
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,660
 Otherwise, we will not get rid of trouble. 

978
01:26:30,035 --> 01:26:31,035
 Girl,... 

979
01:26:31,505 --> 01:26:33,745
 ... Is it in Osman's tent now? 

980
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,580
 Yeah, dad. 

981
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:40,660
 I'm afraid he wants to marry Osman and set up in the bed. 

982
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,600
 It... 

983
01:26:43,805 --> 01:26:45,445
 ... kayı oba becomes a disaster. 

984
01:26:46,185 --> 01:26:47,185
 Lets... 

985
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:48,725
 ...Come with me. 

986
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:52,545
 Raid,... 

987
01:26:53,325 --> 01:26:54,325
 ... belongs to the press. 

988
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,680
 Good health Aybüke. 

989
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,620
 Bon Appetit. 

990
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,620
 Thanks. 

991
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,760
 Thanks. 

992
01:27:24,435 --> 01:27:27,315
 Thank goodness our partner got peace. 

993
01:27:27,885 --> 01:27:28,955
 Thank god. 

994
01:27:29,105 --> 01:27:32,055
 Informal, if I take care of my Ottoman ... 

995
01:27:32,055 --> 01:27:34,285
 ... I don't have eyes. 

996
01:27:49,675 --> 01:27:51,535
 No, Mr. Dundar? 

997
01:27:54,445 --> 01:27:55,515
 I heard that ... 

998
01:27:56,225 --> 01:27:58,175
 ... Bala chick was here. 

999
01:27:58,885 --> 01:28:02,375
 I would like to acknowledge this right with him. 

1000
01:28:05,115 --> 01:28:06,965
 Why did he come to that place? 

1001
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:09,165
 This is what's going on ... 

1002
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:11,235
 Does it have anything to do with literary? 

1003
01:28:13,895 --> 01:28:15,385
 Well, girl, 

1004
01:28:15,945 --> 01:28:19,085
 How did your father reach the alps? 

1005
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:21,345
 He dreamed. 

1006
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:36,155
 Say,... 

1007
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,275
 ... he dreamed. 

1008
01:28:41,145 --> 01:28:43,665
 I wish he had seen it before ... 

1009
01:28:43,665 --> 01:28:45,275
 ... if the Ottomans did not lurk. 

1010
01:28:47,495 --> 01:28:50,205
 It is Allah who saves and saves. 

1011
01:28:51,345 --> 01:28:53,615
 Bala chick says she knows. 

1012
01:28:55,595 --> 01:28:58,415
 What is it, do you not dream? 

1013
01:29:00,275 --> 01:29:02,745
 You talk about this issue face to face with my father. 

1014
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:05,945
 Fortunately, my Lord, Osman forgave you. 

1015
01:29:07,645 --> 01:29:08,745
 Thank god. 

1016
01:29:09,665 --> 01:29:11,355
 Thank goodness he has returned. 

1017
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,660
 However, this fight is told him again, 

1018
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,860
 ... or whether he will mean another soul ... 

1019
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,925
 How do we know? 

1020
01:29:20,925 --> 01:29:22,555
 We, in this oba ... 

1021
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,300
 ... we lived in unity and vitality. 

1022
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:29,200
 All these melandas emerged with the arrival of Edebali. 

1023
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,260
 Uncle! 

1024
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,140
 I'll talk, Osman. 

1025
01:29:33,115 --> 01:29:34,115
 I! 

1026
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:36,775
 Oban ... 

1027
01:29:37,295 --> 01:29:38,295
 ... gentleman! 

1028
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:43,305
 Now,... 

1029
01:29:44,995 --> 01:29:46,215
 ...everyone... 

1030
01:29:46,765 --> 01:29:48,925
 ... you should know exactly what I said. 

1031
01:29:50,285 --> 01:29:52,545
 I am in my ob ... 

1032
01:29:52,745 --> 01:29:54,855
 I don't want my union to be broken. 

1033
01:29:57,755 --> 01:29:59,005
 I'm in this oba ... 

1034
01:29:59,475 --> 01:30:01,165
 .... duality ... 

1035
01:30:01,795 --> 01:30:02,835
 ...I do not want. 

1036
01:30:10,815 --> 01:30:12,845
 What we saw from our ancestor ... 

1037
01:30:13,215 --> 01:30:14,215
 ... dispersed ... 

1038
01:30:14,615 --> 01:30:16,495
 not to be miserable. 

1039
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:19,515
 Taking care of each other, ... 

1040
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:21,445
 ... is to be one. 

1041
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:24,785
 Non,... 

1042
01:30:25,325 --> 01:30:27,385
 ... think about us, Bala chick. 

1043
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:29,955
 This is enough. 

1044
01:30:30,435 --> 01:30:32,055
 More trouble, ... 

1045
01:30:32,755 --> 01:30:34,665
 ... we don't want to be a mess. 

1046
01:30:38,685 --> 01:30:40,395
 As for you, Osman, ... 

1047
01:30:40,885 --> 01:30:42,585
 ... with that Literary ... 

1048
01:30:42,945 --> 01:30:45,215
 ... if you keep on doing business ... 

1049
01:30:45,735 --> 01:30:48,595
 ... you can't see our unofficial support, 

1050
01:30:49,075 --> 01:30:50,075
 ... even you. 

1051
01:30:57,025 --> 01:30:58,585
 Got it, Mr. Dundar! 

1052
01:30:59,485 --> 01:31:02,935
 May Allah keep all sorts of trouble and misery away from your oban. 

1053
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:09,255
 Excuse me. 

1054
01:31:11,185 --> 01:31:12,325
 Come on, Gonca hat. 

1055
01:31:45,285 --> 01:31:46,285
 Osman. 

1056
01:31:48,685 --> 01:31:50,505
 You've survived many trouble. 

1057
01:31:51,065 --> 01:31:52,655
 But now,... 

1058
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,795
 ... it's time to put your mind together. 

1059
01:31:56,435 --> 01:31:59,145
 Literary and daughter ... 

1060
01:31:59,205 --> 01:32:00,205
 ... dervishes ... 

1061
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:03,875
 ... they brought nothing but restlessness to this oba. 

1062
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:05,915
 Bala's chick ... 

1063
01:32:06,785 --> 01:32:08,195
 ... this place has no place. 

1064
01:32:08,855 --> 01:32:09,855
 Uncle! 

1065
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:12,685
 How about you? 

1066
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,660
 The dagger that opened the wounds ... 

1067
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,460
 ... was in Sofia's hands. 

1068
01:32:19,135 --> 01:32:21,695
 The evil spreads from the bosom of the shroud. 

1069
01:32:23,155 --> 01:32:24,565
 What Sheikh Edebali ... 

1070
01:32:25,475 --> 01:32:27,635
 ... where the Bala line has an internal. 

1071
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,085
 Unlike,... 

1072
01:32:31,355 --> 01:32:33,585
 ... they are both our crown. 

1073
01:32:40,885 --> 01:32:41,885
 Osman! 

1074
01:32:43,275 --> 01:32:45,865
 You approach the crossroads, Osman. 

1075
01:32:46,425 --> 01:32:48,655
 Where you belong, ... 

1076
01:32:48,975 --> 01:32:50,625
 ... that's it. 

1077
01:32:51,675 --> 01:32:53,915
 You know who's up for it. 

1078
01:32:57,725 --> 01:32:59,655
 That's why I just don't rebel! 

1079
01:33:01,495 --> 01:33:03,015
 If necessary,... 

1080
01:33:03,605 --> 01:33:05,145
 ... i'm going to slam! 

1081
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,960
 You too ... 

1082
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,560
 that's how you memorize it. 

1083
01:33:30,775 --> 01:33:31,835
 Honey chick! 

1084
01:33:32,145 --> 01:33:33,375
 Honey chick! 

1085
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:36,545
 Honey chick! 

1086
01:33:40,435 --> 01:33:41,815
 Calm down. 

1087
01:33:44,715 --> 01:33:47,925
 If the whole world tries to take you away from me, 

1088
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,400
 ... I don't bow to anyone, you know. 

1089
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,400
 I know, Osman. 

1090
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:55,540
 However, no one should be in trouble because of us. 

1091
01:33:55,855 --> 01:33:58,265
 No one should get a fire in the hearth. 

1092
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,635
 Ahis' head does not stay out of trouble. 

1093
01:34:00,795 --> 01:34:02,675
 The trouble that will come from you, ... 

1094
01:34:03,325 --> 01:34:04,325
 ... the victim of life ... 

1095
01:34:04,405 --> 01:34:05,405
 ... honey chick. 

1096
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,040
 Also, 

1097
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,420
 Where is the literary? 

1098
01:34:12,155 --> 01:34:15,175
 I will send my selcan aunt and ask you informally. 

1099
01:34:23,095 --> 01:34:24,305
 He went to the Ahis. 

1100
01:34:24,855 --> 01:34:26,595
 Did he go to the Ahis? 

1101
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:29,335
 So what are you doing here? 

1102
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,705
 My father found it suitable, Mr. Osman. 

1103
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:35,835
 Honey chick. 

1104
01:34:38,045 --> 01:34:39,495
 Well, what do you keep from me? 

1105
01:34:41,115 --> 01:34:43,045
 I can't say that to you, Osman. 

1106
01:34:47,035 --> 01:34:48,355
 Honey chick! 

1107
01:34:49,155 --> 01:34:51,005
 How can you not say, Bala chick? 

1108
01:34:51,735 --> 01:34:52,735
 I can not say. 

1109
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:55,035
 You are good fortune. 

1110
01:34:55,585 --> 01:34:57,845
 Informally, I wouldn't want you to be in more danger. 

1111
01:34:58,375 --> 01:34:59,815
 He wouldn't want it in my father. 

1112
01:35:01,015 --> 01:35:02,295
 Let me go. 

1113
01:35:03,945 --> 01:35:04,945
 Bala! 

1114
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,385
 Now you will tell me! 

1115
01:35:11,055 --> 01:35:12,305
 Where is your father? 

1116
01:35:13,665 --> 01:35:14,875
 What's going on? 

1117
01:35:15,555 --> 01:35:16,995
 If you don't say the truth, 

1118
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:20,345
 ... you can't take a single step out of the oba. 

1119
01:35:30,335 --> 01:35:32,435
 When he heard what happened to him, he sent me here. 

1120
01:35:33,305 --> 01:35:35,745
 I realized that he will sacrifice for you. 

1121
01:35:47,435 --> 01:35:48,435
 At that time,... 

1122
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:55,100
 It is in the hands of Yannis. 

1123
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:58,320
 Osman Bey, who will give Yannis the treasure for you. 

1124
01:35:58,955 --> 01:35:59,955
 How does he do that? 

1125
01:36:03,015 --> 01:36:04,665
 Don't you know where he went? 

1126
01:36:06,455 --> 01:36:08,675
 Believe me, Osman did not tell me. 

1127
01:36:11,005 --> 01:36:14,055
 The last words he said when he was leaving are still in my mind. 

1128
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:17,920
 "We came from the ground, we will go to the ground," he said. 

1129
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,660
 Separate clay, ... 

1130
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:31,655
 ... to the treasure. 

1131
01:36:33,055 --> 01:36:34,055
 Edebali. 

1132
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,260
 I understand. 

1133
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,440
 I get it, where it is. 

1134
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,620
 Honey, let it stop informal anxiety. 

1135
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,920
 I know where your father is. 

1136
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,100
 How? 

1137
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,420
 First of all, let me save Sheikh Edebali from the hands of the noble. 

1138
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,600
 Then I will want you. 

1139
01:37:00,775 --> 01:37:03,875
 Let's get this uphill, afterwards, with the permission of Allah. 

1140
01:37:10,795 --> 01:37:12,175
 Woe, woe, woe. 

1141
01:37:12,855 --> 01:37:15,775
 You messed up a bag of figs. 

1142
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:19,500
 You are unable even to taste the victory you have won. 

1143
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,820
 This chick is quite with you, 

1144
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,420
 ... there will be no peace in your room! 

1145
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:30,085
 No, Selcan hatun? 

1146
01:37:31,655 --> 01:37:33,695
 You try to break my house? 

1147
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,200
 No,... 

1148
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,920
 ... I try to save the kayi oba. 

1149
01:37:39,085 --> 01:37:40,605
 Selcan yenge! 

1150
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:44,075
 You came to our guest, ... 

1151
01:37:44,075 --> 01:37:45,805
 ... you're the crown of our heads. 

1152
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,740
 Not that,.. 

1153
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,660
 ... do not put your nose in the work of the oba. 

1154
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,320
 Otherwise,.. 

1155
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,020
 ... I have to end your stay. 

1156
01:37:59,525 --> 01:38:00,525
 Well, ... 

1157
01:38:01,045 --> 01:38:02,735
 ... when the husband becomes, 

1158
01:38:03,065 --> 01:38:06,245
 of course there will be someone to rule. 

1159
01:38:10,245 --> 01:38:12,125
 But remember, ... 

1160
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,780
 ... you are not a gentleman. 

1161
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:16,320
 You're just a proxy. 

1162
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,020
 fled. 

1163
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:16,720
 Where is Osman, Megala? 

1164
01:40:17,545 --> 01:40:18,975
 They escaped, sir. 

1165
01:40:19,915 --> 01:40:21,845
 They killed all our men. 

1166
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,300
 Attack! Kill them all! 

1167
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,300
 Ya Allah! 

1168
01:41:07,385 --> 01:41:08,385
 Osman! 

1169
01:41:09,495 --> 01:41:10,495
 I grew up, my Sheikh 

1170
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,620
 Sir, very crowded we have to go right away. 

1171
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,700
 You go and I will embroider them. 

1172
01:43:20,155 --> 01:43:21,155
 No. 

1173
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,420
 It did not. 

1174
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,420
 Rotate more. 

1175
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:27,760
 Look, look ... 

1176
01:43:28,415 --> 01:43:30,155
 how excited my Balaam. 

1177
01:43:30,765 --> 01:43:33,775
 It did, it did. You are so beautiful, mahal. 

1178
01:43:35,865 --> 01:43:38,935
 We entered into many dangers, survived all the badges ... 

1179
01:43:39,835 --> 01:43:42,015
 ... how many times have we returned from death? 

1180
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:43,675
 Not that,... 

1181
01:43:44,065 --> 01:43:46,145
 ... for the first time, my heart beats Gonca. 

1182
01:43:46,565 --> 01:43:49,315
 My Almighty Lord has lowered his heart to love fire ... 

1183
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,860
 honey from her. 

1184
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:55,040
 I hope it will come with goodness and goodness after that. 

1185
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:56,140
 God willing. 

1186
01:43:58,265 --> 01:44:00,185
 Selcan hat will be here soon. 

1187
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:03,875
 My God ... 

1188
01:44:04,325 --> 01:44:06,145
 ... calm my soul. 

1189
01:44:07,635 --> 01:44:09,515
 You're in your father's garden, 

1190
01:44:09,855 --> 01:44:11,445
 ... you are a smile, Bala. 

1191
01:44:12,655 --> 01:44:14,125
 You are his precious. 

1192
01:44:17,515 --> 01:44:18,715
 I don't know, Sheikh, 

1193
01:44:19,085 --> 01:44:20,615
 ... will Osman give you? 

1194
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,000
 My father, from the treasure he gave his life for, 

1195
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,900
 Osman gave up for bey. 

1196
01:44:27,785 --> 01:44:29,575
 He has revealed his own life. 

1197
01:44:29,995 --> 01:44:31,905
 His love for him is clear. 

1198
01:44:33,025 --> 01:44:35,135
 This marriage will also please him. 

1199
01:44:36,325 --> 01:44:37,405
 You're right. 

1200
01:44:37,715 --> 01:44:40,695
 Sheikh2im, Osman does not drop his bravery from his tongue. 

1201
01:44:40,695 --> 01:44:41,955
 He trusts him. 

1202
01:44:42,585 --> 01:44:45,305
 He will not entrust you to him for the sake of him. 

1203
01:44:46,785 --> 01:44:48,875
 Let's look at that time, ... 

1204
01:44:49,585 --> 01:44:50,815
 ... your first child ... 

1205
01:44:51,425 --> 01:44:53,725
 Do you want a boy or a girl? 

1206
01:44:55,305 --> 01:44:57,505
 I would like to have a good son, Gonca. 

1207
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:00,460
 My Lord, everything to our last breath, 

1208
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,280
 ... I wish you good luck. 

1209
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,900
 God willing. 

1210
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,060
 God willing. 

1211
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,700
 Because of us, there is a pusat ... 

1212
01:45:11,015 --> 01:45:12,865
 ... you're on the brink of death. 

1213
01:45:13,405 --> 01:45:15,145
 Exist, Osman. 

1214
01:45:15,655 --> 01:45:17,245
 I surrounded my pusat. 

1215
01:45:18,495 --> 01:45:19,945
 However, I heard that ... 

1216
01:45:20,535 --> 01:45:23,935
 ... you have thrown yourself in the lap of my life for me, Edebali. 

1217
01:45:25,775 --> 01:45:27,725
 They tortured you a lot. 

1218
01:45:28,735 --> 01:45:30,475
 How did you get out of that cender? 

1219
01:45:30,955 --> 01:45:32,905
 From that dark well that I fell ... 

1220
01:45:34,235 --> 01:45:36,805
 ... I came out of your light, Edebali. 

1221
01:45:42,825 --> 01:45:44,725
 The skill is not caring ... 

1222
01:45:45,115 --> 01:45:46,835
 ... sees son. 

1223
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,200
 As you can see, ... 

1224
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,480
 ... that light is at your core. 

1225
01:45:52,665 --> 01:45:53,665
 God willing,... 

1226
01:45:54,215 --> 01:45:57,485
 ... This light will illuminate the horizon of Oghuz. 

1227
01:45:59,175 --> 01:46:00,175
 At that time,... 

1228
01:46:00,475 --> 01:46:02,475
 What is this darkness in my heart? 

1229
01:46:04,115 --> 01:46:06,515
 Why did you delay me when I came to your threshold? 

1230
01:46:09,965 --> 01:46:11,415
 Don't put me off, ... 

1231
01:46:12,605 --> 01:46:15,695
 ... the solution flies more than the wounds in my flesh. 

1232
01:46:17,255 --> 01:46:19,755
 Excuse my cruelty, my toy. 

1233
01:46:24,265 --> 01:46:26,005
 Forgive me. 

1234
01:46:28,795 --> 01:46:30,525
 My Sheikh, Edebali. 

1235
01:46:36,905 --> 01:46:37,905
 I... 

1236
01:46:38,495 --> 01:46:39,995
 I'm not a forgiveness. 

1237
01:46:42,045 --> 01:46:43,795
 But I know that ... 

1238
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:46,435
 ... seeking goodness in himself, 

1239
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:49,095
 ... finds the truth in his heart, son. 

1240
01:46:51,895 --> 01:46:53,315
 Your road is beautiful, ... 

1241
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:55,955
 ... your intention is majestic. 

1242
01:46:58,155 --> 01:46:59,295
 As long as,... 

1243
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:01,595
 ... preserving its essence, ... 

1244
01:47:02,435 --> 01:47:04,225
 ... keep your ore. 

1245
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:20,460
 Father! 

1246
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:32,080
 Who did this to you? 

1247
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,560
 Osman. 

1248
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,120
 Osman. 

1249
01:48:03,775 --> 01:48:05,395
 Call a physician immediately! 

1250
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,480
 Megale ... 

1251
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:24,000
 Megala is dead, my daughter. 

1252
01:48:25,455 --> 01:48:26,955
 Don't worry, sir. 

1253
01:48:28,565 --> 01:48:30,605
 We will take our revenge. 

1254
01:48:40,065 --> 01:48:41,065
 What the hell happened? 

1255
01:48:43,995 --> 01:48:44,995
 Where's the literary? 

1256
01:48:46,965 --> 01:48:48,065
 Where is Osman? 

1257
01:48:49,505 --> 01:48:51,905
 Everything is now exposed. 

1258
01:48:52,955 --> 01:48:53,955
 My daughter... 

1259
01:48:54,995 --> 01:48:58,165
 ... after that there is only blood. 

1260
01:49:07,715 --> 01:49:09,025
 Master Yannis. 

1261
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:14,305
 Boğan paid the price of his own stupidity. 

1262
01:49:14,685 --> 01:49:16,185
 What about you, Salvador? 

1263
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:23,235
 What will you pay for your incompetence? 

1264
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:38,240
 This is the misfortune of Bogan, Kalanos. 

1265
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,440
 However, in Kulucahisar castle ... 

1266
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:44,360
 ... the clumsy live long. 

1267
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,560
 What do you want to say, Salvador? 

1268
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,560
 It is clear what I want to say. 

1269
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:53,220
 While I was a bounty hunter with my men, 

1270
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:54,040
 ..joyful... 

1271
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,420
 Enough! 

1272
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,240
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1273
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:28,520
 I was relieved. 

1274
01:50:30,285 --> 01:50:32,115
 You did this. 

1275
01:50:32,495 --> 01:50:35,985
 I did, father, bon appetit healing. 

1276
01:50:36,955 --> 01:50:40,455
 It resembles the rose sherbet of the deceased mother. 

1277
01:50:41,905 --> 01:50:45,055
 May my Lord fill the graves of light, I hope. 

1278
01:50:45,355 --> 01:50:46,355
 God willing. 

1279
01:50:48,915 --> 01:50:51,565
 What a beautiful son you left me and you went ... 

1280
01:50:51,565 --> 01:50:52,855
 Ulduz chick. 

1281
01:50:54,645 --> 01:50:56,105
 God's friends, 

1282
01:50:56,425 --> 01:50:58,835
 ... be a neighbor. 

1283
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:02,720
 Dad how are you 

1284
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:05,120
 I couldn't get enough of all this. 

1285
01:51:06,475 --> 01:51:08,385
 Osman Bey survived ... 

1286
01:51:10,185 --> 01:51:12,315
 ... is safe in the treasury. 

1287
01:51:12,715 --> 01:51:15,215
 Thank god. 

1288
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:16,915
 Thank god. 

1289
01:51:17,595 --> 01:51:20,925
 Mr. Osman awaits more and more troubles. 

1290
01:51:21,985 --> 01:51:25,325
 May my Lord be his deputy. 

1291
01:51:29,545 --> 01:51:30,545
 Amine. 

1292
01:51:32,145 --> 01:51:33,955
 I want to say something to you. 

1293
01:51:34,965 --> 01:51:36,405
 But I'm afraid. 

1294
01:51:40,915 --> 01:51:43,615
 Don't hesitate, my rose face girl. 

1295
01:51:43,895 --> 01:51:45,025
 lest. 

1296
01:51:45,695 --> 01:51:46,985
 Mr. Osman... 

1297
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:52,145
 Osman bey said ... 

1298
01:51:56,735 --> 01:51:57,985
 Well, my daughter. 

1299
01:51:58,885 --> 01:52:00,725
 What did Osman Bey say? 

1300
01:52:04,425 --> 01:52:06,615
 Selcan would send his chick. 

1301
01:52:08,725 --> 01:52:10,265
 To ask me. 

1302
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,340
 Subhane rabbike rabbil izma amma yesifun, ... 

1303
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:38,220
 ... and then you know, allel murselin ... 

1304
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:42,180
 ... the hamdülil lahi rabbil realm. 

1305
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,720
 Al Fatiha. 

1306
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,780
 Kanturalı ... 

1307
01:54:24,835 --> 01:54:25,835
 ...my brother. 

1308
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,360
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1309
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,860
 Siblings! 

1310
01:54:58,665 --> 01:55:00,615
 We will take your revenge. 

1311
01:55:03,865 --> 01:55:04,865
 We'll get .. 

1312
01:55:13,965 --> 01:55:16,785
 They will drown in the blood they shed, bro. 

1313
01:55:19,015 --> 01:55:20,595
 Our blood will not stay anywhere. 

1314
01:55:40,835 --> 01:55:41,885
 These lands ... 

1315
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,240
 ... until he became a dorm ... 

1316
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:46,940
 ... many coaches ... 

1317
01:55:48,175 --> 01:55:50,365
 ... they watered the land with their blood. 

1318
01:55:58,065 --> 01:55:59,555
 Nice fathers ... 

1319
01:56:02,575 --> 01:56:03,895
 ... son of ... 

1320
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:07,340
 ... into the soil with your own hands ... 

1321
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:08,420
 ... they entrusted it. 

1322
01:56:13,585 --> 01:56:15,345
 Nice love is incomplete. 

1323
01:56:17,885 --> 01:56:19,685
 No. 

1324
01:56:20,695 --> 01:56:22,435
 No. 

1325
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:24,255
 It... 

1326
01:56:24,955 --> 01:56:27,365
 is not a dry country fight. 

1327
01:56:28,025 --> 01:56:29,045
 These souls ... 

1328
01:56:29,365 --> 01:56:30,755
 ... with a coin account ... 

1329
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,980
 ... ambitious pastures were not wasted with love. 

1330
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,380
 This fight ... 

1331
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:39,400
 ... is a fight between truth and superstition. 

1332
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:43,200
 Until the superstition is completely zailed ... 

1333
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:44,320
 ... We will not stop! 

1334
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,320
 We will not stop, Osman. 

1335
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,280
 We will not stop! 

1336
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,540
 We will not give up! 

1337
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:50,840
 We will not go down! 

1338
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:52,840
 God's true religion ... 

1339
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,300
 ... until the judge ... 

1340
01:56:56,055 --> 01:56:58,255
 ... our pusat will not be in the case! 

1341
01:56:59,785 --> 01:57:00,785
 This fight ... 

1342
01:57:01,485 --> 01:57:02,895
 ... crossing the cross ... 

1343
01:57:03,425 --> 01:57:04,915
 ... is the fight of the crescent! 

1344
01:57:05,255 --> 01:57:06,775
 Allahu Akbar! 

1345
01:57:06,775 --> 01:57:08,775
 Allahu Akbar! 

1346
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:27,220
 Allahu Akbar! 

1347
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,440
 Allahu Akbar! 

1348
01:57:39,085 --> 01:57:41,025
 Welcome, Selcan hatun. 

1349
01:57:42,555 --> 01:57:43,585
 Good to see you. 

1350
01:57:44,075 --> 01:57:46,095
 I would like to see Sheikh Edebali. 

1351
01:57:46,095 --> 01:57:49,405
 I have something to say to him. 

1352
01:57:49,405 --> 01:57:52,095
 It is in prayer to the honor of our martyrs. 

1353
01:57:52,135 --> 01:57:53,855
 You wait a little. 

1354
01:59:00,205 --> 01:59:03,355
 Finally, we could see his face laughing like this, Osman. 

1355
01:59:04,555 --> 01:59:06,205
 What is the reason for this state? 

1356
01:59:07,225 --> 01:59:09,215
 Say and we'll be happy too. 

1357
01:59:12,095 --> 01:59:14,115
 I wait for Selcan aunt Aygül. 

1358
01:59:15,205 --> 01:59:16,245
 For me... 

1359
01:59:16,765 --> 01:59:18,645
 ... Bala went to ask for his chick. 

1360
01:59:23,155 --> 01:59:24,155
 Is that so? 

1361
01:59:28,805 --> 01:59:30,585
 May Allah make you happy. 

1362
01:59:33,605 --> 01:59:35,205
 Complete it all. 

1363
01:59:35,525 --> 01:59:36,525
 Amine. 

1364
01:59:38,415 --> 01:59:40,615
 Hopefully Bala's chick and her father ... 

1365
01:59:41,135 --> 01:59:43,375
 ... does not cause big trouble. 

1366
01:59:44,445 --> 01:59:45,925
 But you know, ... 

1367
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,280
 ... the bad luck has been on us since they came to our oba. 

1368
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,440
 Don't say that, Aygül. 

1369
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:59,220
 The bad luck spreads from Kulucahisar, where the shroud is nested. 

1370
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,160
 God... 

1371
02:00:01,825 --> 02:00:03,935
 ... don't let the literature go away. 

1372
02:00:06,265 --> 02:00:07,265
 As for honeymoon ... 

1373
02:00:08,645 --> 02:00:10,825
 ... don't take her name like that in your mouth. 

1374
02:00:12,075 --> 02:00:13,335
 I don't want to break your heart. 

1375
02:00:16,525 --> 02:00:17,865
 Well, Osman. 

1376
02:00:19,135 --> 02:00:20,135
 Well. 

1377
02:00:24,645 --> 02:00:26,935
 Won't you wish me happiness? 

1378
02:00:29,255 --> 02:00:30,455
 Fastest time... 

1379
02:00:31,345 --> 02:00:33,705
 ... We will have a wedding ceremony with Alişar bey. 

1380
02:00:39,605 --> 02:00:40,605
 Non,... 

1381
02:00:42,815 --> 02:00:44,955
 ... you are the pearl of our obese. 

1382
02:00:46,655 --> 02:00:47,655
 Me too... 

1383
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:50,060
 ... in this world and ... 

1384
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,660
 ... you are my sister in the hereafter. 

1385
02:00:54,235 --> 02:00:55,235
 God,... 

1386
02:00:55,395 --> 02:00:56,585
 ... your home 

1387
02:00:57,475 --> 02:00:59,325
 ... let it be the happiest. 

1388
02:00:59,975 --> 02:01:00,985
 Always... 

1389
02:01:02,275 --> 02:01:03,575
 ... happy, happy. 

1390
02:02:04,125 --> 02:02:06,905
 Welcome, good luck, Selcan hatun. 

1391
02:02:06,905 --> 02:02:08,845
 I saw nice, my beautiful girl. 

1392
02:02:09,275 --> 02:02:12,585
 I saw you like this or I became even more happy. 

1393
02:02:13,025 --> 02:02:16,425
 Thank God we've survived the problems. 

1394
02:02:16,475 --> 02:02:19,215
 We will see even better days, evelallah. 

1395
02:02:19,405 --> 02:02:21,845
 I came to meet with Sheikh Edebali. 

1396
02:02:22,095 --> 02:02:23,695
 For a good job. 

1397
02:02:26,575 --> 02:02:28,005
 Here, Selcan hatun. 

1398
02:02:35,405 --> 02:02:36,785
 Your eyes are enlightened, Balaam. 

1399
02:02:37,455 --> 02:02:40,735
 May Allah grant you to chop your wedding in time. 

1400
02:03:02,165 --> 02:03:03,375
 Aygul? 

1401
02:03:03,775 --> 02:03:06,395
 What happened again? 

1402
02:03:07,185 --> 02:03:08,185
 Nothing, mom. 

1403
02:03:12,335 --> 02:03:15,015
 Nothing, why would you shed a tear? 

1404
02:03:15,625 --> 02:03:16,845
 Say it to me. 

1405
02:03:26,215 --> 02:03:27,695
 Mom, I know you'll be angry. 

1406
02:03:28,585 --> 02:03:30,905
 But I can't help it. 

1407
02:03:32,885 --> 02:03:33,925
 Osman. 

1408
02:03:36,765 --> 02:03:37,765
 What did he do? 

1409
02:03:38,665 --> 02:03:39,705
 What did he say upset you? 

1410
02:03:40,675 --> 02:03:42,345
 She didn't do anything to me, mom. 

1411
02:03:43,525 --> 02:03:44,775
 Selcan hatun ... 

1412
02:03:47,495 --> 02:03:50,245
 Selcan hatun went to meet with Edebali. 

1413
02:03:53,995 --> 02:03:56,955
 What is he doing to the chick at the inn? 

1414
02:03:57,365 --> 02:04:00,795
 And what will he meet with Edebeli? 

1415
02:04:03,065 --> 02:04:04,255
 Honey chick. 

1416
02:04:06,515 --> 02:04:09,185
 Osman would want the Bala line. 

1417
02:04:14,835 --> 02:04:15,855
 Especially ... 

1418
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:21,420
 ... was it up to her sister-in-law to ask a girl for Osman while her uncle was standing? 

1419
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,800
 They were all surprised. 

1420
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:25,840
 Wipe away the tear. 

1421
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:29,800
 You're like this today because you dreamed of nothing. 

1422
02:04:35,715 --> 02:04:38,885
 Your fortune is bright girl. 

1423
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:41,780
 The huge starboard is the brain ... 

1424
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:43,840
 ... you will be a babe to your mansion. 

1425
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:47,260
 If Osman goes with this head ... 

1426
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:49,480
 ... both to himself and around ... 

1427
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:51,980
 ... will bring nothing but trouble. 

1428
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,795
 That he will cry like a spian, 

1429
02:04:56,795 --> 02:04:58,815
 ... thank the yacht get up. 

1430
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,360
 Finally, we have survived a difficult test Selcan hatun. 

1431
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,500
 Thank you. 

1432
02:05:11,655 --> 02:05:12,775
 My God... 

1433
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:16,640
 ... salute our hearts the next way. 

1434
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:18,000
 Amine. 

1435
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:23,580
 Praise be to Allah, of course. 

1436
02:05:23,885 --> 02:05:26,675
 However, you are not paid. 

1437
02:05:27,145 --> 02:05:29,355
 You have claimed my Ottoman. 

1438
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,140
 You guarded and watched. 

1439
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:33,140
 God bless you. 

1440
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:37,520
 Yiğit is not alone, Selcan hatun. 

1441
02:05:38,775 --> 02:05:41,025
 Even though no one is with you ... 

1442
02:05:41,615 --> 02:05:43,655
 ... the way of walking with Allah ... 

1443
02:05:44,135 --> 02:05:46,375
 ... necessarily gets better. 

1444
02:05:47,945 --> 02:05:49,465
 We didn't do anything. 

1445
02:05:50,805 --> 02:05:53,095
 Whatever happened is right. 

1446
02:05:53,355 --> 02:05:54,885
 Osman in our son ... 

1447
02:05:55,525 --> 02:05:57,935
 ... survived with faith ... 

1448
02:05:58,775 --> 02:06:00,335
 ... from this struggle ... 

1449
02:06:00,875 --> 02:06:03,185
 ... survived with the belief. 

1450
02:06:08,975 --> 02:06:09,975
 Sir,... 

1451
02:06:10,675 --> 02:06:13,315
 ... you tell Osman to my son. 

1452
02:06:14,545 --> 02:06:17,965
 We would also like to say that our daughter is a Bala woman. 

1453
02:06:18,995 --> 02:06:21,715
 Bala chick is very well bred, ... 

1454
02:06:21,715 --> 02:06:24,355
 ... is a very beautiful girl. 

1455
02:06:26,535 --> 02:06:28,315
 If you have permission ... 

1456
02:06:28,905 --> 02:06:32,245
 ... we want to illuminate our obese with light. 

1457
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:37,960
 Allah's command, with the prophet's tribe ... 

1458
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:40,000
 ... your daughter Honeymoon ... 

1459
02:06:40,005 --> 02:06:42,545
 ... we want our son Osmana. 

1460
02:06:55,285 --> 02:06:56,795
 Thank you, chick. 

1461
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:59,860
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1462
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,680
 I mean something, dad. 

1463
02:07:19,485 --> 02:07:21,035
 Is there permission? 

1464
02:07:21,545 --> 02:07:23,065
 Come on girl. 

1465
02:07:23,835 --> 02:07:24,905
 Here you go. 

1466
02:07:34,035 --> 02:07:35,965
 I thought about what you said, dad. 

1467
02:07:38,575 --> 02:07:40,135
 If you see fit ... 

1468
02:07:40,235 --> 02:07:42,965
 ... I have my consent with Alişar bey. 

1469
02:07:55,005 --> 02:07:56,915
 Is this your consent, girl? 

1470
02:07:58,215 --> 02:08:01,395
 Does me or your mother have an internal? 

1471
02:08:02,425 --> 02:08:03,645
 Be sure no dad. 

1472
02:08:04,815 --> 02:08:06,645
 First of all, obam comes. 

1473
02:08:07,085 --> 02:08:08,375
 I know that ... 

1474
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:12,340
 ... my obba and my family's fortune are in trouble. 

1475
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:13,800
 OK then,... 

1476
02:08:15,995 --> 02:08:17,755
 What about your fortune? 

1477
02:08:26,405 --> 02:08:27,635
 My good fortune, 

1478
02:08:28,005 --> 02:08:29,845
 ... in your happiness, dad. 

1479
02:08:31,155 --> 02:08:33,785
 Give me the best about God, girl. 

1480
02:08:35,585 --> 02:08:38,495
 This crunchy happiness to you, .... 

1481
02:08:38,495 --> 02:08:41,325
 ... hopefully bring strength and strength to our obese. 

1482
02:08:45,385 --> 02:08:46,385
 God willing. 

1483
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:52,145
 We also set up the nest, 

1484
02:08:52,915 --> 02:08:53,915
 ... protects sooner. 

1485
02:08:54,745 --> 02:08:57,055
 If you wish a happy marriage ... 

1486
02:08:57,285 --> 02:08:58,575
 ... Do not forget you. 

1487
02:08:59,605 --> 02:09:01,265
 Smokeless chimney, ... 

1488
02:09:01,875 --> 02:09:03,925
 ... no husband without wife, my daughter. 

1489
02:10:23,665 --> 02:10:26,195
 You hung your love in my heart. 

1490
02:10:28,465 --> 02:10:29,465
 Non,... 

1491
02:10:31,305 --> 02:10:32,795
 ... beyond you ... 

1492
02:10:33,825 --> 02:10:35,525
 ... it is death, Bala chick. 

1493
02:10:46,805 --> 02:10:50,275
 Our Almighty Lord has commanded his servants to marry. 

1494
02:10:51,295 --> 02:10:53,585
 Installing a home is destined. 

1495
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,860
 And certainly at the wedding ... 

1496
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:58,460
 ... there is miracle. 

1497
02:10:59,215 --> 02:11:02,085
 Osman bey wrist brace, 

1498
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:04,600
 his heart is fearless. 

1499
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:05,940
 I know. 

1500
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:10,780
 The brave young man is a fierce warrior. 

1501
02:11:14,365 --> 02:11:15,995
 As for honeymoon ... 

1502
02:11:17,315 --> 02:11:18,315
 ... Bala ... 

1503
02:11:19,045 --> 02:11:21,315
 ... raised in the way of Allah ... 

1504
02:11:21,315 --> 02:11:23,385
 ... is the head of the smokers. 

1505
02:11:24,805 --> 02:11:27,045
 Sure, I'd like to set up a home one day. 

1506
02:11:31,075 --> 02:11:32,075
 Not that,... 

1507
02:11:33,425 --> 02:11:35,795
 ... marriage requires bail. 

1508
02:11:37,315 --> 02:11:39,165
 If there is no surety ... 

1509
02:11:39,695 --> 02:11:41,915
 ... trouble arises. 

1510
02:11:46,035 --> 02:11:47,635
 That is what I mean ... 

1511
02:11:49,675 --> 02:11:51,405
 ... Osman and Bala ... 

1512
02:11:52,515 --> 02:11:53,625
 ... is not equivalent. 

1513
02:12:00,265 --> 02:12:01,765
 I don't want to break my heart. 

1514
02:12:03,365 --> 02:12:04,365
 Not that,... 

1515
02:12:05,785 --> 02:12:07,665
 ... I do not consent to this. 

1516
02:12:32,395 --> 02:12:33,835
 Kara Osmanim. 

1517
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,220
 You have no appetite? 

1518
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,700
 So just stands in front of you? 

1519
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:41,160
 No, no. 

1520
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:44,920
 The fluttering of his heart comes to my ears, Osman. 

1521
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:47,020
 (Laughing) 

1522
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:50,460
 Well, Mr. Bamsi. 

1523
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:53,240
 Is it a matter of appetite? 

1524
02:12:53,795 --> 02:12:55,325
 Put a wedding on it, ... 

1525
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:58,520
 ... I'll show everyone how to hit the sword. 

1526
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:01,580
 Vote... 

1527
02:13:02,505 --> 02:13:05,635
 Vote my pusat sharp black Osman. 

1528
02:13:05,635 --> 02:13:07,585
 You grew up now ... 

1529
02:13:07,585 --> 02:13:09,585
 ... do you wait for the wedding news? 

1530
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,760
 Best of all, this job is over ... 

1531
02:13:15,255 --> 02:13:17,395
 ... knocked forty coaches in front of the bed ... 

1532
02:13:17,395 --> 02:13:20,395
 ... if I don't turn the obo into an end-to-end familiar. 

1533
02:13:23,975 --> 02:13:25,415
 Sama sergeant! 

1534
02:13:26,285 --> 02:13:29,125
 It'd be nice if we had a head on you. 

1535
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,520
 Relation Honor brother. 

1536
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,820
 Sama brain pusat is again moist. 

1537
02:13:37,595 --> 02:13:40,345
 You can eat in front of you alps. 

1538
02:13:40,345 --> 02:13:43,435
 Everybody eat in front of you. 

1539
02:13:45,445 --> 02:13:46,735
 Erkut Alp! 

1540
02:13:48,195 --> 02:13:51,285
 You have no sound, no? 

1541
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,280
 Let him go, Abdurrahman Gazi. 

1542
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:56,840
 If it is up to him, he will marry us all, so that he can eat a folder. 

1543
02:13:57,255 --> 02:13:58,845
 (Laughing) 

1544
02:14:05,235 --> 02:14:06,235
 Aunt. 

1545
02:14:37,085 --> 02:14:38,255
 No aunty? 

1546
02:14:42,245 --> 02:14:43,245
 What is this situation? 

1547
02:14:44,875 --> 02:14:45,975
 Osmar my ... 

1548
02:14:48,855 --> 02:14:50,355
 ... Sheikh Edebali ... 

1549
02:14:54,295 --> 02:14:56,085
 ... did not see fit. 

1550
02:15:06,125 --> 02:15:07,965
 There is no consent, he says.

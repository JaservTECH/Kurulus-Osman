1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,320
 [Wolf howls] 

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:01:55,520
 [Generic music.] 

3
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,220
 Gentlemen, leaving each other under compassion does not lead us to abuse. 

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,740
 Obligation to listen to Osman is obvious. 

5
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,460
 A dying tekfur is the son of an extreme brain allegedly killed. 

6
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,900
 Please note that one of the sides is Byzantine and the other is Seljuk. 

7
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,060
 I would like to establish a fair court in Söğüt Inn tomorrow. 

8
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,160
 Why Willow, not Kulucahisar? 

9
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,380
 Osman committed many of the crimes charged to him in Kulucachisar. 

10
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,560
 We must judge him! 

11
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,320
 What matters is not the judgment but the revelation of the facts Kalanoz! 

12
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,760
 What kind of blessings you gave to Kulucahisar? 

13
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,120
 ... which gentleman will be? 

14
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,440
 Alişar Bey is right, Kalanoz. 

15
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,840
 Osman Söğüt should be tried so that no one should have a question in mind. 

16
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,640
 A court to be set up at the fair hypothesis of our women ... 

17
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,700
 ... is the most reasonable for all of us. We consent to this. 

18
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:39,600
 As long as the peace base that we came to the brink of my late friend Yorgopolos is rebuilt. 

19
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,660
 For unusual reasons, do not splash blood on our hands. 

20
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,060
 Osman is now a fugitive. You couldn't even keep it in the caged tent in your own obesity. 

21
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,920
 What if Söğüt does not come to the Inn? 

22
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,060
 At that time, including the murder of tekfur ... 

23
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,840
 ... accepts all the crimes. 

24
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,860
 I am sure that Osman Bey will come to that court. 

25
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,820
 Keep your heart fresh. 

26
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,560
 Even her uncle could not hold her. 

27
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,620
 How can you be so sure of this? 

28
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,000
 The Turkmen at this end are like crazy foals, Sofia. 

29
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,460
 Each one has a different link but the same post they are attached to. 

30
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,560
 Here I am, that pole itself. 

31
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,980
 Turkmen oba was not born from the mother's womb to say a word on my word. 

32
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,340
 If Osman does not come alive ... 

33
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,240
 ... his body comes. 

34
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,140
 This word is the word of the starboard chief Alişar. 

35
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,060
 If you trust yourself so much, as a friend ... 

36
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,360
 ... it is up to us to rely on your word. 

37
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,600
 We will wait for your news, Alişar Bey. 

38
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,660
 Truth will come out tomorrow. 

39
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,740
 I hope it will be beneficial for all of us. 

40
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,200
 [The door closes.] 

41
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,240
 Who is this, Osman? 

42
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,540
 There is no need, Bamsı Bey. 

43
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,360
 Where is Literary? 

44
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,660
 He sent me. 

45
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 My name is Zülfikar. 

46
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
 Let's get to the thesis. 

47
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,380
 Bamsı Bey, you take precautions here. 

48
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,500
 Thank you Osman, thank you. 

49
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,000
 [Horses are turning.] 

50
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 [The sheep are bleating.] 

51
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,280
 Alişar Bey stretches the rope to his hand. 

52
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
 I saw it is not distant from Osman. 

53
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,140
 That is why he moved the court to Söğüt. 

54
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,000
 Alişar Bey establishes the wolf table, my nephew. 

55
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,380
 He establishes that he wishes him to be out of breath. 

56
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,980
 It is true that he puts a string down the well, but ... 

57
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,280
 ... whether this rope will take us out of the well, tether it will be around our neck, we will see it all together. 

58
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,320
 What if he made a decision against Osman against the court? 

59
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,420
 Are we going to sacrifice my garbage? 

60
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,260
 First of all, we need to find Osman. 

61
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,680
 We need to provide the evidence to convince the court that Osman is not guilty. 

62
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,320
 Then... 

63
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,120
 ... I will pay him the price of his cruelty to Batur! 

64
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,380
 Osman is my blood, my dear. 

65
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,000
 Only I can punish you. 

66
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,520
 [Hit the drum.] 

67
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,320
 Thank you, I hope. 

68
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
 They are the Alps of Osman. 

69
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,680
 You came! 

70
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,040
 Bosphorus gardaş, take Tursun to the healing tent. 

71
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,140
 Thank you garda. 

72
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,260
 We will take Bala Hatun to Ertuğrul Bey's bed, come on! 

73
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,500
 There are wounded. 

74
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,580
 Boran alp! 

75
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,860
 The fur shop is where the fox will turn around. 

76
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,760
 We are not permanent, Mr. Dundar. 

77
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,360
 I decide who stays in this camp and who goes! 

78
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,300
 Who is this chick? 

79
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,940
 She is the daughter of Sheikh Edebalı, Bala Hatun. 

80
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,340
 Was the daughter of Edebalı, the chick kidnapped from the market? 

81
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,860
 It is true. 

82
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,900
 My son ordered his father to be hosted in his room. 

83
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,920
 Didn't your heart be enough, but he sent his chick with you? 

84
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
 My master's heart will not fit in this place or this end! 

85
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,920
 It is not at the Kayi ceremony to keep a Muslim woman seeking healing in front of her car. 

86
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,820
 We burn the world for a drop of blood! 

87
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,000
 Get news about Zöhre Hatun, get your thesis interested. 

88
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,820
 Edebalı's daughter is also our daughter. 

89
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,500
 Come on, take it. 

90
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,280
 I Selamınaleyk. 

91
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,200
 And hello. 

92
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,860
 Zülfikar derviş said that you knew the past. 

93
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,400
 Bala Hatun fights in the grip of death. 

94
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,060
 What are you looking for here? 

95
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,760
 Batur, take Osman's alps to the caged tent. 

96
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,100
 Don't let it go anywhere until Osman Bey returns! 

97
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,780
 Mr. Dundar, you go to the fire with a blower. 

98
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,740
 The fire did not catch fire, Boran alp. 

99
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,540
 Ignition was. 

100
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,000
 Your command is on my head, sir. 

101
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,600
 Thank God we had a precious clay. 

102
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,700
 It was worth all the trouble, Zülfikar? What do you say? 

103
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,960
 The judgment is yours, sir. 

104
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,800
 Literature is not the order of coping. 

105
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
 There is no time. 

106
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,600
 It's not easy, son. 

107
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,780
 It is not easy. 

108
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,240
 (Exhales.) 

109
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,380
 Being or not is not easy to exist. 

110
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,660
 Making a secret cube is not easy, son. It requires patience first and then labor. 

111
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,280
 He wants a sweat from his eye and sweat from his forehead. 

112
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
 You will collect mud first ... 

113
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,300
 ... you will separate the clay in the mud from the stone. 

114
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,540
 The stronger this clay is, the more the jar becomes. 

115
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,800
 Bala Hatun dies in the camp. 

116
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,880
 So his story is similar to the same person. 

117
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,940
 Just as the glaze cube is made of earth ... 

118
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,720
 ... man was also created from soil. 

119
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,160
 If the master is good and the essence is good ... 

120
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,980
 ... both take easy form. 

121
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,240
 So is man, Osman Bey. 

122
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,540
 Crude is. It burns, cooks and happens. 

123
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,140
 If the clay is flawed, the finishing is incomplete and the fire is low ... 

124
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,000
 ... the cube burns, water flows. 

125
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,840
 Just as the incomplete Adam is raw. 

126
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:54,100
 The fire that potted the earth is the patience that makes the man swear. 

127
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,520
 Ha secret cube, human. 

128
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,880
 My daughter Bala, if she confronts many suffering ... 

129
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,400
 ... if he survives a lot of trouble, if he aspires to a lot of trouble ... 

130
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,160
 the reward is his, the winner is Him. 

131
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,440
 What, you think, you wouldn't be subject to an exam called Edebalı's daughter? 

132
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,580
 On Judgment Day ... 

133
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,460
 ... it would be nice to see that nobody would benefit anyone on that day, huh Osmancık? 

134
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,960
 Didn't our master say, "Even that day my daughter will not benefit my Fatiima." 

135
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,600
 It beats the pulse weakly. 

136
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,980
 This is poisoned, nothing can be done. 

137
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
 It will die. 

138
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,080
 He is the trust of Osman. 

139
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,400
 This is the quarry of Hayme Ana. 

140
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,520
 Whoever comes to this door and seeks healing is irreversible. 

141
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
 Let's boil castor oil, we need to induce vomiting. 

142
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,540
 Castor oil boil. 

143
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,160
 Give me a diaper. 

144
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,840
 Now Osmancık, you should say the trouble. 

145
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,220
 They wanted to make you pay a price. 

146
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,900
 They ask for the treasure from you. 

147
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,440
 If you don't ... 

148
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,000
 your daughter Bala will die soon. 

149
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
 The devil's children! 

150
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,780
 They think death is still from poison. 

151
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,300
 The demons have these arrogance, their arrogance! 

152
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
 This devil did not prostrate to Adam either. 

153
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,860
 Unless the right commanded death, what if they drink a thousand poisons ... 

154
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,800
 What if my son died? 

155
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,760
 We are happy that he became a neighbor to our Rasul in the Hereafter. 

156
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,980
 You're right. 

157
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:43,800
 Those who do not know how to sacrifice, who cannot afford to sacrifice, who cannot realize being mortal ... 

158
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,680
 ... don't expect the consent. 

159
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,340
 Is it easy to get out of the truth because I am a believer, Osmancık? 

160
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,740
 A believer is a scout. 

161
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,580
 Izzet is the one who does not forget the truth in a thousand troubles and a thousand mercy. 

162
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,820
 So, will we stand like this with our hands tied? 

163
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,260
 She is the daughter of Sofia Yannis. 

164
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
 Yannis's a girl? 

165
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,720
 Let's see what Yannis will do when you take it. 

166
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,440
 How do you know I will get all this, Sofia? 

167
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,940
 Our life was passed by removing the clay of the earth from the bosom of the son, son. 

168
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,280
 Our eyes, I suppose, realize the human. 

169
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,100
 Now I go to Okan to be a guest. 

170
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,060
 What if you bring the antidote ... 

171
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,940
 ... if you don't, don't worry. 

172
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,640
 Our case is to have ant consciousness. 

173
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
 Our ranks are enough. 

174
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,080
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

175
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,980
 The correct lesson is Literary. What is the value of this treasure? 

176
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
 It's a piece of wood, son. 

177
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
 A piece of wood. 

178
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,080
 I would like to listen to a time. Now I have to start. 

179
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,920
 You can always be sirat, son. 

180
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,440
 Farewell. 

181
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,760
 Aslı and Kerem ... 

182
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,740
 ... I tried so hard, it's finally over. 

183
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,740
 Open your eyes, Aygül. The dead of this was put in the gentleman's room. 

184
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,620
 Think about where the rest is put. 

185
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,840
 Look what it says here, Sofia. 

186
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,060
 A verse from Surah Hucurat in the Qur'an. 

187
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,620
 Believers are only brothers. 

188
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,860
 The Qur'an calls them to unity, togetherness, brotherhood in exactly eighty-two places. 

189
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,140
 Here is our starting point, Sofia. 

190
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,880
 In a big fire of fire to burn. 

191
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,320
 Now I'm listening to you. What information did you bring from Kayı Obası? 

192
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,940
 Kayı Obası is boiling, sir. 

193
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,300
 Dundar is very angry with Osman. 

194
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,560
 We can use this anger. 

195
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,840
 Because he does not count the principality of Osman Dündar. 

196
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,640
 Dundar may be a gentleman, but the spirit of Osman, son of Ertugrul, is circulating in Kayi quarters. 

197
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,180
 I feel it Sofia. 

198
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,780
 Osman will be a problem not only for us but also for Dündar. 

199
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,740
 The fire of this fire that we fueled will take us to the treasure. 

200
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,980
 Do you think Osman knows the location of the treasure? 

201
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,260
 It is impossible for Osman to know the location of the treasure. 

202
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,660
 Edebalı never tells the secret of the Ahis. 

203
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,840
 She is in love with that girl enough to even meet Edebalı. 

204
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,080
 You will see, it will bring the treasure. 

205
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,980
 [Door knocks.] 

206
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,700
 Master Yannis, information came from Nizamettin, sir. 

207
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,120
 Tell me, Helen. 

208
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,740
 Osman Bala sent Hatun to Kayı Obası. 

209
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,860
 Love... 

210
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,620
 ... I bow with respect once more before your power. 

211
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,000
 I testified to the power of love, when I put my hands in the blood of tekfur. 

212
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,040
 But Osman, we cannot be sure what he will do. 

213
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 Be sure to bring the treasure of the Ahis, Kalanoz. 

214
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:37,600
 The love in you, the hatred he has for me; will bring the treasure to me sooner. 

215
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,760
 When it comes, we will take our precaution. 

216
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,500
 I am Alişar Bey. 

217
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,880
 What do the fish and people have in common, you know, Nizamettin? 

218
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,640
 When both unnecessarily open his mouth, he gets into trouble. 

219
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,940
 Now she coughs what's on her belly. 

220
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,220
 Sir, to be your eyes, your hearing is your greatest bliss, you know. 

221
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,620
 It did not fit in me, and I brought it to you. 

222
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,480
 I don't like crowded mouth. 

223
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,760
 Honey, tell me thesis! 

224
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,440
 Bala Hatun, the daughter of Sheikh Edebalı, was poisoned. 

225
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,540
 They brought it to Kayı Obası. 

226
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
 What are they doing? 

227
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,140
 Bey, even more important, with Osman Samsa Sergeant. 

228
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,460
 Probably Sheikh Edebalı is with them. 

229
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,080
 (Breathe.) 

230
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,460
 (Exhales.) 

231
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,240
 So, Adabalı bellows the fire of Osman. 

232
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,900
 Let's extinguish that fire ... 

233
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,320
 ... keep our word in this land. 

234
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,280
 Now go find Osman. Say, Alişar Bey is calling you to court. 

235
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,960
 What if he doesn't want to come, sir. 

236
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,840
 The future promised me. 

237
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,500
 If he doesn't come, I'll remove his gras. 

238
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,800
 I blind the shield pus for everyone. 

239
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,360
 Osman is very hot. Do not harm Nizamettin? 

240
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,120
 You will sacrifice bread for the fish to be satiated, Zorba. 

241
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,280
 My father... 

242
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,740
 ... took your voice ... 

243
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,220
 ... I would take your life if it was up to me. 

244
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,020
 If you are a fire, you will burn as much space as Batur. 

245
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,400
 It is an honor for us, whether our alpine is taken or not, in the way of our Osman Bey. 

246
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,840
 Your turn will also come to Osman. 

247
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,440
 If you have a little heart, untie my hands! 

248
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,720
 Solve! 

249
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:58,300
 I will solve, I will solve, but first of all you will see what punishment is! 

250
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,260
 You will all know what punishment is! 

251
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,560
 You will all learn! Everyone will learn what punishment is, everyone will know! 

252
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,920
 Well, we kissed his hand, and we split his bread with our hands. Come on, Gardaş. 

253
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,220
 We kissed each other's hands and broke our breath. 

254
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,140
 Even the weed we pressed with our feet is healing for us. 

255
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,460
 O Samsa Sergeant. 

256
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,280
 Thank you. 

257
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,340
 Such souls roar with tree leaves. 

258
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,300
 Thank you! 

259
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,820
 Is there a destruction, Osman Bey? 

260
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,140
 Come Çetin alp. 

261
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,460
 Mr. Nizamettin, the manager of Yeni Pazar, came. 

262
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 If you give me dastur, they have something to tell you. 

263
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,380
 Let's come, let's find out what the meaning is. 

264
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,020
 They call me at all ends. 

265
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,780
 When did you hear and came? 

266
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,080
 As you know, Osman Bey is more valuable than money. 

267
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,840
 You will have eyes and ears everywhere so that you know. 

268
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,800
 May you be awake. 

269
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
 One day your eyes will be blind. 

270
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,920
 Your ear is deaf 

271
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,740
 Shall I take his eye and ear from his capital, Osman Bey? 

272
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,400
 Let it go, Samsa Sergeant. 

273
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,880
 Well, what is the trouble that brought you here like a wind? 

274
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,340
 Alişar Bey asks you to go to court tomorrow and defend yourself. 

275
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,340
 Whether real killers appear. 

276
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:53,520
 Whether you go on hunting again with you like in the old days. 

277
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,560
 Say hello to Alişar Bey and be good cheer. 

278
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,780
 Everything will be revealed tomorrow. 

279
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,520
 Hatun, what is Bala Hatun's past? 

280
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,660
 Mr. Gündüz is not good. 

281
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,480
 Poisoned chick. 

282
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,400
 I don't know if he gets healed tomorrow. 

283
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,320
 Is there any destim, sir? 

284
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,640
 Come sword alp. 

285
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,280
 [Door opens.] 

286
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,100
 My Sheikh Sheikh Edevalı came. 

287
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
 Don't wait, please. 

288
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,200
 I Selamınaleyk. 

289
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,040
 I Aleykümselam. 

290
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,860
 You brought peace to Ertuğrul Gazi's room, Edebalı. 

291
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,580
 Welcome. 

292
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,740
 We're [I'm] glad to be here. 

293
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
 Well, son. 

294
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,260
 Is Bala Hatun inside? 

295
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,880
 Gonca Hatun is next to her. 

296
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,480
 It rests. 

297
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,940
 If you will excuse me, I wish to see my daughter. 

298
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,280
 Estağfirullah. 

299
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,280
 Osman broke the ceremony, broke you. 

300
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,680
 Let Osman give the punishment he deserves. 

301
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,400
 Osman does not only threaten your good fortune, his son or our son. 

302
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,580
 It also threatens Aygül. 

303
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,180
 What do you mean, chick? 

304
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,720
 Guys I ... 

305
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,120
 ... Aygül Osman has lost his heart. 

306
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,020
 Osman has no hearts in Aygül. Aygül before eating himself ... 

307
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,240
 ... we should take action. 

308
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,420
 How? 

309
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,160
 A marriage that will strengthen its power will bring peace to both Aygül and us. 

310
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,900
 What do you mean, chick? 

311
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,340
 Who goes through your mind? 

312
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,700
 Alişar Bey. 

313
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,280
 Alişar Bey's chick passed away last year. 

314
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,960
 I would like to take a look at Alişar Bey and Aygül. 

315
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,920
 When he came to the place with Sofia and Kalanoz today, I saw how Alişar Bey looked at Aygül. 

316
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,780
 I think it is useful to come together with Alişar Bey at thesis time and open this issue. 

317
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,240
 Aygul ... 

318
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,300
 Is there any destim, sir? 

319
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,880
 You're coming. 

320
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,660
 [Door opens.] 

321
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,180
 Yaman this is no time at night? 

322
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,880
 Beyim, Sheikh Edebalı is in our obese. 

323
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,320
 My Yaman, keep your eyes on him. 

324
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,460
 I will be aware of every step he takes. 

325
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,720
 This is yours, sir. 

326
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,400
 [The door closes.] 

327
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,080
 What are we going to do, sir? 

328
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,260
 Literary means trouble. 

329
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:21,840
 It means to draw the anger of Mongolian and the suspicion of Seljuks upon us. 

330
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,100
 I am afraid there is a connection between Osman and Edebalı chick. 

331
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,680
 Won't you go out and say hi, sir? 

332
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,100
 (Laughs.) 

333
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,740
 There is no hurry. Let him embrace a daughter, let her suffer. 

334
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:52,000
 Remember, prey that leaves a mark; trail ... 

335
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,860
 ... are hunters. 

336
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,320
 Hacer was so helpless in our mother ... 

337
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,400
 ... A small amount of water left by Hz. 

338
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:25,920
 Our mother Hacer, who is worried that her son Ismail will die of thirst in the desolation of Mecca ... 

339
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,540
 ... started to look for water with anxiety between Safa and Merve hills. 

340
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,840
 When the number of departures reaches seven ... 

341
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:45,520
 ... his son İsmail's extinction was exhausted. Thirst had shaken his little body. 

342
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,040
 He hit his heels on the ground with the wisdom of his Lord. 

343
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,360
 Our mother suddenly heard a voice ... 

344
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:03,780
 He turned to look at that a water source gushing from where he left Ismail. 

345
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,480
 The appeal of Gabriel as Ismail ... 

346
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:21,400
 ... Seeing the troubles of our mother Hagar, there was a water supply to the earth upon the permission of Allah. 

347
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,860
 They called that water the Zamzam. 

348
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,120
 I hope it is healing for believers. 

349
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,260
 God willing. 

350
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,380
 I hope my daughter will endure until the antidote comes. 

351
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,520
 I wish Osman had never grown. 

352
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,160
 If there were always children. If he did not stand in front of me and leave my bottom. 

353
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,880
 While being in trouble all the time, keeping quiet just to prevent the oba from being damaged ... 

354
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,820
 ... unofficially touches me, chick. 

355
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,220
 I'm daytime, brave. All oba knows your fairness and justice. 

356
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,120
 Don't let yourself pay like this. This is Osman ... 

357
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,040
 ... neither fits nor palms. You both know her black eyes. 

358
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,500
 He takes care of your head, you don't worry. 

359
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,540
 No chick. This time it is not so, chick. 

360
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,400
 He is in great trouble. 

361
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,620
 The worry that it will happen to me will take my place. 

362
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,120
 If he does not appear in court tomorrow, he will have accepted the sentence. 

363
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,980
 Everyone finds the blame in him. Everyone is loaded onto it. 

364
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,040
 You won't leave Osman alone, will you? 

365
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,820
 Never! 

366
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,700
 As much as it makes me sad, he is my garrison. 

367
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,700
 My wolf-eyed garbage. 

368
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,100
 He is my father's trust to me. 

369
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,500
 Then it is your duty to protect your trust. 

370
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,280
 I took my precaution. 

371
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,660
 Otherwise, I will kidnap Osman personally. 

372
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,580
 My emm is unaware. 

373
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,840
 I won't leave my garbage in anyone's hands, nobody! 

374
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,600
 Flood goes, stone remains ... 

375
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,420
 ... the hand goes and the stag remains. 

376
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,780
 Suleyman Shah, his grandson, Ertugrul Gazi son Gündüz Bey was also good for this. 

377
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,760
 May Allah make our way clear. 

378
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
 Amen chick, amen. 

379
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,860
 Aybars! 

380
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,260
 I hope my dear friend will take revenge and vomit the oppressors. 

381
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,200
 What's happening in here? 

382
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,840
 Get out! 

383
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,680
 Inept guys! 

384
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,720
 Why are you tiring yourself so much, princess? 

385
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,860
 We have to be prepared for everything, Commander. 

386
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,680
 Have all the measures been taken? 

387
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,720
 Don't worry, it's okay but ... 

388
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,400
 I don't understand why is this treasure so valuable? 

389
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,420
 Let's pass the apricots and the ahis on the sword. 

390
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,880
 Let's solve this job radically! 

391
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:26,800
 If it was that easy, we'd have already done this by now, Kalanoz. 

392
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,360
 What's hard, Sofia? We have a strong army. 

393
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,220
 Our swords are sharp, behind us is the Byzantine Emperor. All we need is a powerful battle pipe! 

394
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,580
 When these Turks are left alone, they fall into each other. 

395
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,980
 But when an external enemy is seen, they unite and turn into dragons. 

396
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,820
 It has always been this way, it will be like this from now on. 

397
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:15,220
 But don't worry, Master Yannis's mind will make us superior to them. 

398
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,060
 I can't wait to take Osman, but ... 

399
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,120
 ... this is Osman. 

400
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,640
 There is Alişar Bey in the business. Osman has to listen to his word. 

401
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,260
 If he does not, he accepts the crime. 

402
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,880
 Then Alişar Bey will find him before us. 

403
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,400
 It's time, let's go and get Osman! 

404
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,700
 [Reading Surah Aidiyat.] 

405
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,740
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

406
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,540
 [Meali.] 

407
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:13,680
 I swear by those who run fast (to the war), those who shoot (with their fingernails from the ground), those who flock in the morning, those who mix the dust into the smoke, then those who dive into the middle of a community, 

408
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:37,640
 Surely man is very ungrateful to his Lord. And he himself witnesses this. Indeed, he is strict because he loves world goods. Doesn't he know that the contents of the graves will be thrown, and the contents of the flies will be compiled. 

409
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,780
 Why would you tie the horse's tail? 

410
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,200
 To know, son, to know. 

411
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,920
 Let me know what? 

412
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,300
 This road is the road to gas, if there is a martyrdom on this road ... 

413
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
 ... to know that this bond will be cut. 

414
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,620
 Oghuz ceremony is son! 

415
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:27,740
 We tie the horse's tail so that it knows where it's going to be the square to the gas. 

416
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,500
 If the owner becomes a martyr ... 

417
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,420
 ... let him know that he will cut his tail and become a brick to the alps. 

418
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,680
 Thank you sir. 

419
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,940
 Ya Allah! 

420
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,460
 (Osman pulls his sword.) 

421
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,220
 This pusat is my friend Aybars's pusat. 

422
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:21,680
 This pusat that does not go into the tub for the revenge of my garbage today ... 

423
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,760
 ... be a wild bird and enter my heart. 

424
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,080
 This is my day, martyrs! 

425
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:38,240
 This is the day of burning hell fire in the bosom of the shroud! 

426
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,840
 Allahu Akbar! 

427
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,200
 (They bring together a single one.) 

428
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
 Allahu Akbar! 

429
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,660
 Allahu Akbar! 

430
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,240
 (They bring together a single one.) 

431
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,740
 Protect Princess Sofia! 

432
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,240
 Protect it! 

433
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,540
 They are here! 

434
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,820
 I would have expected to see you in court, Osman Bey. 

435
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,900
 I decided to set up the divine justice court here, Sofia! 

436
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,700
 I think I'll be the judge of that court! 

437
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,860
 It's hunting time! 

438
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,520
 He brought us to the game! 

439
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,920
 You sealed the death warrant of Bala Hatun Osman Bey! 

440
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,480
 Alps! 

441
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,040
 I am a non-edict and a seal! 

442
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,580
 Come on God! 

443
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,820
 (All together.) God is right! 

444
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,620
 I want Osman alive! 

445
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,680
 We set up a fair court in the courts of our own women, Dündar Bey. 

446
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,400
 Regardless of the outcome, we will replace peace in Söğüt! 

447
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:53,400
 Osman broke the peace that my brother Ertuğrul Bey established on his way. 

448
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,200
 Today, all problems must be solved here. 

449
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,900
 We will walk to the future together, Alişar Bey. 

450
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,520
 Do not worry, Dundar Bey. Let's go. 

451
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,080
 The women are also about to come. 

452
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,520
 Sit on the back of the inn too, otherwise ... 

453
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,660
 ... we will take Osman! 

454
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,380
 The sword is alp, even if I am absorbed, no Osman! 

455
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,720
 Osman, you are entrusted to me by my mother. 

456
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,000
 I don't make you feed anyone! 

457
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:44,540
 [Lightning sounds.] 

458
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,520
 In the past, treacherous days have not survived! 

459
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,880
 Deyyus! 

460
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,520
 You will find the trouble, Osman! 

461
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:10,500
 With this sinister word, you chopped my son ... 

462
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:18,000
 ... if I don't cut that bitch tongue, death is forbidden to me. 

463
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,240
 (Laughs.) 

464
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:26,480
 They told me about every sword blow that broke the flesh of his son. 

465
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,860
 His death was as severe as his pain. 

466
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,780
 Don't Bamsı! 

467
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,720
 Don't Bamsı! 

468
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,560
 The Bams! 

469
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,700
 The Bams! 

470
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,700
 Mr. Bamsı! 

471
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,360
 Mr. Bamsı! 

472
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,740
 You're going to Söğüt, court, Andreas. 

473
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,240
 Tell everyone what I am. 

474
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,600
 Say to them, Osman did not escape from the court. 

475
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:43,460
 Osman took Sofia's murderer Sofia. 

476
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,260
 Since Alparslan ... 

477
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,180
 ... your two hundred year long curse has expired. 

478
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,980
 Mr. Osman! 

479
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,560
 You will not even have graves in this land! 

480
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,300
 After our martyrs, Fatiha is read. 

481
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,700
 Nobody will remember you! 

482
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,860
 You gave the order to your dogs to kill Aybars. 

483
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,480
 I won't let you martyr Bala Hatun! 

484
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:37,620
 Now go, Yannis say to you ... 

485
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,860
 ... if she wants her daughter Sofia ... 

486
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,960
 ... bring me the cure of Bala Hatun. 

487
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,360
 Or... 

488
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,560
 ... I'll kill your daughter! 

489
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,140
 I will wait for you in the room. 

490
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,200
 If you don't come ... 

491
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,020
 ... I will shed Sofia's blood! 

492
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,560
 You can not do this. 

493
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,840
 No Kalanoz! 

494
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,680
 You can't let the Turks win! 

495
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,640
 Do not go! 

496
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,420
 Do not go! 

497
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,180
 Don't go! 

498
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,860
 Kalanoz! 

499
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,880
 Do not go! 

500
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,220
 Don't go! 

501
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,140
 Kalanoz! 

502
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,220
 Do not go! 

503
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,300
 The poison shows its effect, that's why it's sweating, sir. 

504
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,900
 It is earthly poison in my daughter's blood ... 

505
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,600
 ... there is healing. 

506
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,080
 I hope he will recover. 

507
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,180
 Hopefully sir. 

508
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,340
 But there are such poisons ... 

509
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,280
 ... when it comes to mind, it captures a person. 

510
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,560
 It never comes out without killing the heart. 

511
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,100
 For example, jealousy. 

512
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,140
 For example, grudge and grudge. 

513
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:12,940
 The Messenger of Allah was asked who is the top of the people. 

514
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:21,800
 The two world servants said, "Anyone with a heart-reverberant, true to the word." 

515
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:30,020
 Ashab was surprised. Ya Rasulullah, we know the correct dictionary ... 

516
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,800
 ... they asked what the heart was meant for. 

517
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,640
 Our master filtered everyone and said: 

518
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:46,060
 "This is an immaculate heart that fears God." 

519
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:57,460
 He said, "There is no sin in it, there is no cruelty, envy or hatred." 

520
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,840
 [Door opens.] 

521
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,440
 [The door closes.] 

522
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,200
 This is Kalanoz's man, what's going on? 

523
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,860
 Where is Princess Sofia? 

524
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,060
 Osman took the princess Sofia. 

525
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,880
 He sent me here to let you know. 

526
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,820
 Oh, my dear friend, it won't be good. 

527
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,400
 Osman, Osman you chewed me. 

528
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,140
 You broke the state! 

529
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,460
 The state will chew you too! 

530
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,360
 Bully, get my horse ready! 

531
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:09,840
 Mr. Gündüz, inform the thesis alps. We're going to find Osman. 

532
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,020
 [The door closes.] 

533
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,800
 (She breathes and leaves.) 

534
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:48,660
 Farabi, scholars like you ... 

535
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:58,540
 ... If the warriors like Osman were from my religion, the kingdom of God would prevail in this world. 

536
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,600
 Commander Kalanoz! 

537
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,900
 What is this situation, Kalanoz? What happened to you? 

538
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,980
 Osman took Sofia. 

539
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,800
 He wants you the life of Bala Hatun in exchange for Sofia's life. 

540
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,840
 Where? 

541
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,060
 In the Dark Valley. 

542
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,880
 Osman, damn you and your offspring Osman! 

543
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,920
 Is Sofia your daughter? 

544
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,640
 Only Literary would know this. 

545
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,300
 So they kidnapped Sofia. 

546
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,980
 That's right. 

547
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,740
 Sofia is your daughter. 

548
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:16,020
 How does Edebalı know this secret that you keep from everyone? 

549
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,660
 No more secrets, Kalanoz. 

550
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,900
 Now there is only death. 

551
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,340
 Now listen to me. 

552
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,540
 My Sheikh. 

553
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,200
 Ya Shafi. 

554
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,880
 Medet Allah. 

555
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,440
 Ya Shafi. Medet Allah. 

556
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,560
 Ya Shafi. Medet Allah. 

557
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:42,340
 Ya Shafi. Medet Allah. 

558
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,640
 Ya Shafi. 

559
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,160
 Father. 

560
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,900
 Medet Allah. 

561
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,980
 You will survive, Bala, less last. Less more. 

562
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,120
 Less last! 

563
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,580
 Medet Allah. 

564
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,200
 Either bismillah. 

565
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,780
 God give him strength, my Lord! 

566
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,380
 Ya Shafi. Medet Allah. 

567
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,520
 Medet Allah. 

568
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:34,700
 Samsa Sergeant, keep an eye on Sofia. 

569
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,960
 Osman, you will find the trouble! 

570
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,540
 You will pay the sin of the crimes you have committed! 

571
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,320
 Is there a destruction? 

572
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,700
 You're up, son. 

573
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,480
 I Selamınaleyk. 

574
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,140
 I Aleykümselam. 

575
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,760
 Shut up, give me the bone of your creaking mouth! 

576
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,660
 Sofia ... 

577
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,780
 today is your account day. 

578
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,040
 My Aybars' blood won't stay on the floor! 

579
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,580
 Osman deceived all of you. 

580
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,680
 He did it to escape from the court, wake up now. 

581
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:51,000
 You will also pay for the sin he has committed, and your obey! 

582
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,440
 Leave me! 

583
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,260
 How is Ahvali Ayşe aunt? 

584
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,780
 It's not good, Osman. 

585
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,320
 I hope it will be good, Ayşe aunt. 

586
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,160
 It will be good. 

587
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,480
 God willing. 

588
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,740
 [Door opens.] 

589
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:25,980
 Princess Sofia? 

590
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,060
 Alişar Bey. 

591
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,060
 What's going on? Osman kidnapped me and killed my soldiers. 

592
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,960
 What does this mean Bamsı? Free Princess Sofia now! 

593
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,460
 Osman, where are you? 

594
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,620
 Do you call me Alişar Bey? 

595
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,780
 Osman, son of Ertuğrul Gazi, does not escape justice! 

596
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,820
 Did you not specify this for so long, Alişar Bey? 

597
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:07,640
 Either take control of Osman or take the war, Alişar Bey! 

598
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,240
 Soldiers, catch Osman Bey! 

599
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,640
 (They pull the swords.) 

600
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,560
 Now, do you rebel against the state? 

601
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,320
 Why don't you trust my word, Alişar Bey? 

602
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,820
 I said it would be a fair court. 

603
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,720
 I kept my word. Not me... 

604
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,520
 ... you will judge Sofia. 

605
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,260
 Osman! 

606
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,380
 Justice will find its place here in my father's office today. 

607
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:44,400
 Now you can listen to the truth from me, Alişar Bey. 

608
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,140
 [Door opens.] 

609
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,740
 I kept my word. 

610
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,740
 The medicine is here, Osman Bey. 

611
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,320
 It is the healing of Bala. 

612
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,300
 Thank god. 

613
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,320
 Help me, girl. 

614
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,400
 Let's drink the healing. 

615
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,580
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

616
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,720
 O Lord, the healing is from you. 

617
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,560
 Mercy is from you. 

618
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,220
 Medet from you. 

619
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,400
 Ya Shafi. 

620
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:30,040
 Ya Shafi. 

621
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:35,880
 Ya Shafi. Ya Shafi. 

622
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:41,260
 (They call Ya Shafi all together.) 

623
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:47,400
 This pusat is the puset of my martyr, Aybars. 

624
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,300
 So far, the honor of this pusat was mine. 

625
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:03,240
 I trust you and leave the honor of this pusat in your hands, Alişar Bey. 

626
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,880
 Is it true what Osman Bey said, Kalanoz? 

627
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,000
 So you pressed the market place. 

628
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:47,460
 We are not. The monk Yannis, who was also the murderer of our tekfur, made it. 

629
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,480
 Did you miss your mind, Kalanoz? 

630
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,660
 Master Yannis is a holy man. 

631
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,720
 How would you say that? 

632
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,400
 This is now our domestic affair. We will solve this ourselves. 

633
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,620
 This is not true! All three of you were in the event. 

634
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:17,200
 We withdraw all the charges against Osman Bey. 

635
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,380
 I took Bala Hatun's healing and had Yannis thrown into the dungeon. 

636
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,620
 Tonight I will question and execute tomorrow. 

637
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,680
 You lie, you lie! 

638
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,960
 My son's murderers are all of you! 

639
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,880
 Yannis killed your son Aybars. 

640
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,220
 I am sorry for this. 

641
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,280
 I invite you all to death tomorrow. 

642
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,600
 You will witness Yannis' death with your own eyes! 

643
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,120
 Princess Sofia is innocent. 

644
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,280
 If you don't want a war ... 

645
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,600
 I want you to release him immediately. 

646
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:13,600
 I won't let this happen! 

647
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,460
 Osman, enough! 

648
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:26,460
 Aybars' perpetrator was found both in the market raid. 

649
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,680
 Bala Hatun will survive thanks to Kalanoz. 

650
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,880
 Osman, what more do you want? 

651
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,500
 Justice! 

652
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,820
 I will not stop until justice is found! 

653
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,580
 I will continue the peace and trade agreement with Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

654
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,880
 This issue is now closed here, Alişar Bey. 

655
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:01,120
 Otherwise, we will lose many brave people in this land! 

656
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,320
 Ya Shafi. 

657
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,680
 Ya Shafi. 

658
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,820
 Ya Shafi. 

659
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,840
 Ya Shafi. 

660
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,420
 Ya Shafi. 

661
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,200
 Ya Shafi. 

662
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,040
 Ya Shafi. 

663
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,760
 Ya Shafi. 

664
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,840
 Ya Shafi. 

665
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,420
 Ya Shafi. 

666
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,460
 Ya Shafi. 

667
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,740
 Ya Shafi. 

668
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,060
 Father. 

669
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,980
 My daughter. 

670
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,940
 Bud. 

671
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,060
 Thank goodness my Lord. 

672
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,000
 Thank god. 

673
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,200
 Thank God! 

674
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,520
 Thank god. 

675
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,080
 Thank god. 

676
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,600
 Thank god. 

677
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,940
 You're free to go, Kalanoz. 

678
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,720
 I don't want any hostility anymore. 

679
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,380
 Otherwise, the price will be heavy! 

680
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:47,900
 Commander! Take Princess Sofia and commander Kalanoz to the castle! 

681
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,380
 If anything happens to you, I'll get your head off! 

682
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,780
 You're welcome, sir. 

683
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,160
 No no no! 

684
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:09,160
 Shake my son's killer with his hand and shake it, I won't let him go! 

685
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:14,520
 Osman! 

686
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,740
 Osman, enough! 

687
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,940
 You confront our Obese with Seljuk. 

688
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,120
 Enough! 

689
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,160
 My eyes will be on you, Kalanoz! 

690
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,780
 This job is not over for me yet. 

691
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:49,740
 Mr. Bamsı, we will go to witness the execution of Yannis tomorrow. 

692
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:17,080
 Tomorrow, when Yannis shakes in his narrow tree, you will realize that I am right, Osman. 

693
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,300
 [Door opens.] 

694
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,040
 [The door closes.] 

695
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,240
 God, why did you leave me alone? 

696
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,180
 I fought for your kingdom, my life. 

697
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:09,620
 Forgive me, I couldn't leave Sofia in their hands. 

698
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:33,080
 Quench the truth in my soul, save my soul from this pain. 

699
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:43,140
 I beg my god to forgive my sins, deliberately or unknowingly, my misdemeanors! 

700
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,520
 Great god, help us! 

701
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,040
 Mercy and protect. 

702
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,540
 (He whips himself.) 

703
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,320
 (He whips himself.) 

704
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,900
 Squeeze a little tooth, I'm Tursun. 

705
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,100
 In a few moments, he suffers from pain. 

706
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,040
 With the permission of Allah, nothing remains. 

707
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:30,180
 These sores in my chest hurt less than I do in my heart. 

708
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,120
 What have you got in your heart? 

709
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,140
 We look at the sky is sickle ... 

710
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,540
 ... we look at the ground is solid. 

711
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,800
 How do we get out of this moment we fall into? 

712
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,380
 Sunday was published. 

713
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:54,620
 All of our men have migrated to the hereafter. 

714
01:28:55,940 --> 01:29:00,660
 These voyages, did Tursun dagger his patience. 

715
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:15,580
 Of course, the floor under us shows a way out which quilts the chest over us. 

716
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,720
 Long live Tursun. 

717
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:30,400
 Amenna sheikh, amenna. Our stalls are wasted ... 

718
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,460
 ... our goods are rüsva. 

719
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,180
 It will take quite a while for us to recover. 

720
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:44,440
 What did he say, the dervish Yunus, who we have become at the door of your adore in Nallıhan ... 

721
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:51,500
 .... "We are reborn from all things, who is usana." 

722
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:07,640
 The old man whom you gave this plate in the market ... 

723
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,060
 Yannis was the monk dressed as a dervish. 

724
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:23,200
 What Hak Resul said came. 

725
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:28,180
 Ahi has been a sight ... 

726
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,940
 ... it happens. 

727
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:38,320
 The world of fisks and facets is filled. 

728
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:40,840
 Sure. 

729
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,940
 See all kinds of litigation, guys. 

730
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,760
 Your hand is your eye. 

731
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,860
 I couldn't stop leaving it there. 

732
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,000
 Thinking about their love ... 

733
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:07,540
 ... I found solace on his deathbed. 

734
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,960
 If I was ash like the original ... 

735
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,180
 ... I don't eat any gamut. 

736
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,840
 You entered my life. 

737
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,060
 I won't let you go again, Bala Hatun. 

738
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,580
 If you say so ... 

739
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,360
 ... ask me from my father then! 

740
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,340
 If you excuse me ... 

741
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:09,560
 ...at that time... 

742
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,300
 I will ask you when my father returns. 

743
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,240
 Excuse me. 

744
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,660
 Is there a destruction, Osman Bey? 

745
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,160
 Come on. 

746
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:08,220
 [Door opens.] 

747
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,380
 Well, what happened? 

748
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,180
 (She's breathing in her nose.) 

749
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,740
 What's up? 

750
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:27,380
 Dundar Bey Beyim not only to throw our alps into the caged tent ... 

751
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,360
 ... he took his bros with his pusat and threw them from the alpine. 

752
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,440
 It's time to showdown with Dündar Bey. 

753
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:53,040
 Since we defend the following goal from our head ... 

754
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,900
 ... let's compile the informal oba. 

755
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:02,100
 We have not been able to come to this trade position for a long time. 

756
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:08,860
 The new market recovers. It is necessary to produce plenty of goods in the kilimhouse. 

757
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:11,040
 Do not worry about that, Dundar Bey. 

758
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,840
 Kayi girls will overcome. 

759
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:20,020
 When the looms are rebuilt, the most reputable fabrics will be those of Kayı. 

760
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:20,980
 Hallelujah. 

761
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:25,280
 Thank goodness we got rid of the sentence problems in our heads. 

762
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:29,060
 Informal after that is up to our determination. 

763
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,520
 No, my nephew ... 

764
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:36,900
 ... we did not get rid of all the troubles. 

765
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:42,040
 I have an account to see with Osman. 

766
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,020
 Because the taste of this business has been thoroughly missed. 

767
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:56,120
 I do not intend to sacrifice this oba to Osman's toy. 

768
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,660
 I am very curious, there have been so many badires ... 

769
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,620
 ... don't he have a word to say to his suck, or even an explanation? 

770
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,420
 Not just to say ... 

771
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:11,660
 I have an account to ask, Mr. Dundar! 

772
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,700
 You threw my alps into the caged tent. 

773
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:23,340
 I will account for the Alps, Osman. 

774
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:26,580
 You give me my Batur account! 

775
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,260
 I had an account with Batur ... 

776
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,560
 I saw him in front of the bed. 

777
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:42,100
 Now, let me release my alps! 

778
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,120
 Otherwise... 

779
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,340
 Otherwise... 

780
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,980
 what Osman? 

781
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,140
 I finish the job I left half with Batur. 

782
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,060
 Emmi, you heard about Kalanoz yourself ... 

783
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,620
 Osman was right. 

784
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:08,900
 Need to unleash the Alps. 

785
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:14,880
 Gündüz, do not enter my call with Osman! 

786
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:19,800
 He pursues Aybars' revenge. 

787
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:25,560
 But my son's blood still stands in front of the room. 

788
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,800
 He paid the price of his son's betrayal. 

789
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,060
 Osman, sure! 

790
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,660
 Enough, enough! 

791
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:43,620
 Osman... 

792
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:50,220
 look, your brother will spin you. 

793
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,540
 He was involved in the daytime. 

794
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,460
 If you say so ... 

795
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,500
 ... will you dagger us too? 

796
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:13,580
 With us, blood is washed with blood! 

797
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,960
 Don't you know 

798
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,920
 Emmi! 

799
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,880
 If you want blood ... 

800
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,600
 Take blood! 

801
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,660
 [Lightning sound.] 

802
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,840
 I knew you wouldn't betray me, Kalanoz. 

803
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,500
 There was no other way I could save you, Sofia. 

804
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:54,380
 So it was a game. 

805
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:59,740
 We have great ideals that connect us. 

806
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,200
 It's not just our ideals. 

807
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,680
 But is this execution, the execution of Kalanoz, your request? 

808
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:16,780
 Yes girl, I will die. 

809
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:21,900
 I have to be executed before Osman and others. 

810
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,920
 I would never let that happen! 

811
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,820
 To do this, they must first kill me. 

812
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:34,120
 The first thing they taught us at the Margarit Monastery was this ... 

813
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,980
 ... you can never live without dying, Sofia. 

814
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:55,380
 (Crying). 

815
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,000
 Osman... 

816
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:04,660
 ... how can you do this to yourself, Osman? 

817
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,680
 What is this situation, Aygül? 

818
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,280
 Didn't you see Osman? 

819
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,620
 He stabbed himself. 

820
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,260
 Don't you have any stigma? 

821
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,240
 Don't you have anything? 

822
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:26,080
 You are Aygül Hatun, the daughter of Dündar Bey. 

823
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:30,620
 What do you cry like? Let the thesis come to you! 

824
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:31,560
 Mother... 

825
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,240
 If these conditions continue, you should never call me a mother again! 

826
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,280
 How about the main? I... 

827
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:46,240
 You cry for Osman. Shedding blood of his brother, disregarding father, brain ... 

828
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,400
 ... you cry for Osman Aygül! 

829
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,840
 Get out of this room, get out. 

830
01:42:54,940 --> 01:43:00,700
 He took all the obstacle behind him. Osman is upsetting your father. 

831
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,440
 You shed tears for him, huh? 

832
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,840
 Look, Os ... 

833
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,020
 I say shut up! You should be ashamed of the blood of Kayı walking around your veins! 

834
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,900
 Look, girl, you will be a strong gentleman for your father's fortune. 

835
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:26,640
 You will marry a strong gentleman, and you will make your father strong! 

836
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:30,980
 Not with the gentleman and the son, but with the starboard. 

837
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,740
 You will marry Alişar Bey, Aygül! 

838
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:40,880
 The mother will die, the mother will not die! 

839
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,740
 I finished my word, Aygül. 

840
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,280
 You shouldn't say anything on it. 

841
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:50,840
 If you don't say what I already said, you will die in my eyes! 

842
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,240
 Osman was blindfolded, too. 

843
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:11,760
 Yes my Sheikh. Neither Bala Hatun lived, nor Tursun Fakih. 

844
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:23,340
 It is Allah Who puts faith and courage in our hearts. 

845
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:32,240
 As for Osman. The essence is the essence waiting to be processed. 

846
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:39,880
 If it is beaten well, it is seasoned on fire, if it is tempered in water ... 

847
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,480
 a sharp pusat. 

848
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:49,120
 If there is no manners, a pile of iron. 

849
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,900
 [Door opens.] 

850
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:57,460
 Osman! 

851
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:12,820
 Osman Bey, what happened to you? 

852
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,200
 We cut our own punishment ourselves. 

853
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,640
 No fuss. Edebalı. 

854
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,780
 Did you dagger yourself? 

855
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,020
 The dagger stuck in my meat ... 

856
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,300
 ... but the blood was spilled from Dündar Bey. 

857
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,260
 Do not forget you ... 

858
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:53,480
 ... the blood wound holds the crust, the grudge scar does not. 

859
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,360
 You rest here. 

860
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:17,560
 I will go to the alpine tent. 

861
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,040
 Thank you Osman Bey. 

862
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,560
 Thank you. 

863
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,180
 You will clean the wound. 

864
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,060
 I'll set up a stove. We need to brand the wound. 

865
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,500
 I Selamınaleyk. 

866
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,440
 I Aleykümselam. 

867
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,760
 Boran son ... 

868
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,840
 What is this kid? 

869
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,700
 Nothing important, Bamsı Bey. 

870
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:53,360
 If there is nothing important, what are these wounds Boran gardaş? 

871
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,960
 Who did this to you? 

872
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:06,180
 Who did this to you? 

873
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,560
 Batur arrived Konur Alp ... 

874
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:12,760
 This is after. 

875
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:15,980
 What thesis has forgotten the pain of the dagger that Batur ate! 

876
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,300
 Now I'll take his blood! 

877
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,120
 Samsa Bey, let those who are here not leave this tent. 

878
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,160
 Osman Bey should not forget his troubles and worry about it. 

879
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:34,140
 Samsa Sergeant says Boran Alp right. 

880
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,620
 Time is not then. 

881
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:43,720
 If not today, tomorrow ... 

882
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,160
 ... the next day if there is no tomorrow. 

883
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,920
 The blood that spills doesn't stay on the ground, Boran gardaş 

884
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:54,200
 Batur will not stay with you! 

885
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,460
 This will not stay with you. 

886
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:05,180
 We swallowed blood today, but we will vomit blood in time! 

887
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,400
 Thank you brother, thank you. 

888
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:41,340
 Oh, my dear Osman. 

889
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:45,800
 When will your blood be stopped? 

890
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,060
 Look at you! 

891
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:53,920
 There's a lot of blood to flow, brother. 

892
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:56,860
 There's a lot of blood to flow! 

893
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,100
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

894
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:42,000
 As you said, brother. The alpine cuts its core. 

895
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,060
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

896
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:07,700
 (He breathes fast.) 

897
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,980
 Erkut Alp, you are a destination. Osman Bey is where you learn. 

898
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:40,520
 Thank you sir. 

899
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:00,740
 Mix two in Erkut Alp, mix a stomach. 

900
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:02,820
 (They all laugh.) 

901
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:08,060
 Konur gardaş has both lessons and is also under the ground. 

902
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:10,620
 (They all laugh.) 

903
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:17,520
 I know, Boran gardaş, I know. If we said two mixes, the other mixture is the pure heart. 

904
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,160
 Thank you. 

905
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:26,180
 When you came to Oba, you gave your coat to Osman Bey and his tent to me. 

906
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:29,080
 Tonight you are a guest in my tent. 

907
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:33,200
 I won't leave you anywhere, Samsa Sergeant. 

908
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:36,160
 (They laugh.) 

909
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:42,360
 Thank you Konur Alp. We do not intend to go anywhere either. 

910
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:45,300
 Thank you for my brave. 

911
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:54,120
 No, Erkut, do you worry because we ate your right? 

912
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,240
 (They laugh.) 

913
01:52:58,720 --> 01:52:59,780
 hayrolsun? 

914
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,420
 Good, you're seated. 

915
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:18,600
 Hayrola Bamsı Bey? 

916
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:25,400
 My sons, Osman had some pastimes. 

917
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:31,400
 Now it is not appropriate to scatter the gathered toys. 

918
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:35,960
 So let's get started then. 

919
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:38,880
 Come on, bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

920
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:42,060
 Thank you sir. 

921
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,440
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

922
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,560
 [Door opens.] 

923
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,140
 Does it suit his daughter, these tears Aygül Hatun? 

924
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,240
 I am not with you when Osman's blood is flowing. 

925
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:26,780
 So go, go to him! 

926
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:31,360
 He shed his brother's blood, let him leave tears in your eyes, go! 

927
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:35,940
 Burçin, enough! Not come over me! 

928
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,620
 Just what you are! 

929
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:44,480
 Your eyes do not see the informality from Osman, but Osman's eye sees only Bala. 

930
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:50,460
 Since I knew myself, no one else than Osman came in my heart Burçin! 

931
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:54,880
 What happened, Aygül? Did you hear a sweet word in your life? 

932
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:56,940
 Did you see a smile? 

933
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:02,660
 Tell me, is it worth it for the tear you shed for him? Is it worth it Aygül? 

934
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:12,720
 God, give me the strength to bear! 

935
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:20,620
 Or take this dear! I beg you, let me get rid of it! 

936
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:37,060
 Mr. Osman. 

937
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:47,620
 You have respected us, you have hosted your father. 

938
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:54,160
 If Gündüz Bey permits, I may owe you a word. 

939
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:02,900
 [Door opens.] 

940
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:05,300
 [The door closes.] 

941
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:19,880
 The competitors reported ... 

942
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,040
 ... you cut someone's hand at the market place. 

943
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:26,240
 He was stealing. 

944
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,980
 Now you hurt yourself. 

945
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,040
 I cut my own punishment. 

946
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,220
 Are you justice, Osman Bey? 

947
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,040
 If necessary, it's mine! 

948
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:47,160
 Do you think justice is provided by brute force and black pusat? 

949
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,980
 What does it mean when a black pus is not the right of unfairness? 

950
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,300
 Justice comes. 

951
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:59,700
 Justice, seeing the mind in white milk ... 

952
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:05,560
 ... it requires to sense the black snake on the black stone. 

953
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:12,080
 Justice is not just polat wrist, black pusat ... 

954
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:16,020
 ... also requires prudence and forgiveness. 

955
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:27,240
 Hz. Osama brought martyrdom during a war and killed someone who wished. 

956
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:31,820
 Our Prophet summoned Osama. 

957
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:38,920
 "Did you kill someone who declared your faith?" 

958
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:45,040
 Osama said, "He did it like fear." 

959
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:56,000
 ... our two world suns lord said, "You help her heart so you read your intent, you know your intent?" 

960
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:04,420
 Osman Bey, without asking, without consulting ... 

961
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:14,040
 ... without weighing the back; If you are a thief, is it true that you apply justice according to your head? 

962
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,280
 Behold the woman? 

963
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,040
 Behold witnesses? 

964
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,500
 The court? 

965
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:30,500
 You give the verdict, do you apply it? 

966
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:36,780
 Besides, we are not in the position of reading hearts. 

967
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:41,480
 If we have such a trick ... 

968
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:45,400
 ... we must first read our own heart. 

969
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:53,340
 Let's come to the bleeding wound ... 

970
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:01,180
 Our Prophet Mustafa Sav, our master ... 

971
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:12,380
 ... even Ebu'd Derda, who keeps himself away from all world flavors and harms his body ... 

972
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:19,620
 ... "Your ego is your wrist, be nice to him." 

973
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:25,580
 ... is it true that you hurt yourself, dagger yourself? 

974
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,560
 Osman... 

975
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:38,380
 Osman, who suddenly caught fire like a flame of straw ... 

976
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:42,680
 ... Osmancik. 

977
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:52,940
 Let us walk justice when we walk to you, laugh at mercy when you smile ... 

978
01:59:53,560 --> 02:00:01,880
 ... when he resists the persecution, we say that he will be patient and see the state. 

979
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:04,800
 What would you do? 

980
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:17,220
 Toy Osmancık, raw Osmancık. 

981
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:22,640
 The hard work of the thesis is less. 

982
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,480
 So you know this! 

983
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,560
 Ee Boran, son ... 

984
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:02,820
 The horse's feet are bulky, the bard language is nimble. 

985
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:06,720
 Neither our prayers are silent, nor our poets! 

986
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,600
 Come on, let us tell you a saying. 

987
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,560
 Talk with Dombra ... 

988
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:16,840
 ... the judgment is the brain. 

989
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,660
 Is it old or happy, Bamsı? 

990
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:28,240
 Son, neither be old nor joy. 

991
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:32,720
 Whether wise, wise boy. 

992
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:39,600
 My Ertuğrul Bey loves Sevdayı Muhammed's saying very much. 

993
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:43,260
 Tell us him. 

994
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:44,460
 Thank you sir. 

995
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:53,320
 At that time... 

996
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,540
 ... Pir to Turkestan ... 

997
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,100
 ... let's reach the slopes of the big Yesevi. 

998
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:00,140
 Oh let's get there. 

999
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:05,820
 Let's arrive, let's arrive, let our hearts be washed with his wisdom, son. 

1000
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:06,900
 Thank you. 

1001
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:17,020
 (Dombra starts playing.) 

1002
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,480
 I hope my bravery! 

1003
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:38,100
 Thank you sir. 

1004
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:44,160
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1005
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:47,860
 O my Lord ... 

1006
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:54,040
 ... our love and our fight ... 

1007
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,220
 ... our aim is Muhammad. 

1008
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:07,140
 It is our hakan that we are always obedient. 

1009
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:12,180
 We descend to the warlord squares with his name ... 

1010
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:15,320
 ... with his name, we will have our wishes. 

1011
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:22,720
 Ya Hak! We have processed it to our hearts. 

1012
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:29,260
 We cultivated it to our efforts, we processed it to our pupils. 

1013
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:36,160
 My Lord, don't make our efforts back from his wish. 

1014
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,140
 Amine. 

1015
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:39,520
 Ya! 

1016
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:45,740
 If we are hungry, we will be filled with his name. 

1017
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,980
 If we are naked, we dress with her affection. 

1018
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:57,060
 If we die, we live with his cause! 

1019
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:03,780
 O God, our dear is He ... 

1020
02:08:04,340 --> 02:08:06,700
 the blood we pour out is for him. 

1021
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:12,660
 The glory we take, the name we keep; it's all for it. 

1022
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:15,120
 My God... 

1023
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:19,200
 ... us and even our generation ... 

1024
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:22,780
 ... don't take it away from it and its path. 

1025
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:23,840
 Amine. 

1026
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:28,580
 Because Ertuğrul Gazi are the ones ... 

1027
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,700
 ... can't do without it! 

1028
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:36,860
 He gives his life, he cannot give his life! 

1029
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:39,440
 Amine. 

1030
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,420
 Thank you. 

1031
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:18,720
 I will ask you when my father returns. 

1032
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:58,860
 Welcome Aygül Hatun. 

1033
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:03,460
 This is the spot of my absorption, you are the one who came, but you are not welcome. 

1034
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:10,620
 All your wounds died in the market, and you look at a plate and grin, chick! 

1035
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:16,680
 Say to me ... 

1036
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:21,700
 ... what's your secret hiding? 

1037
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:28,200
 Our competitors are dead ... 

1038
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:32,020
 May Allah's mercy be upon them. 

1039
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:38,320
 However, I know I'm back from death. 

1040
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:41,720
 Since you have touched our obes, there is no calamity on us. 

1041
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:47,320
 I know best, death is around you, chick. 

1042
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:52,340
 Who says I know, know nothing! 

1043
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:58,360
 We have no intention of missing anyone's peace. 

1044
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,840
 We have no intention but you have a caste. 

1045
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:04,800
 Osman ... 

1046
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:10,160
 ... Osman's head was out of trouble. 

1047
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:15,720
 First, his blood brother Aybars died. 

1048
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:20,140
 Then he grabbed my brother from your face. 

1049
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:23,200
 Now he shed his own blood. 

1050
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:28,500
 Let Osman's collar burn! 

1051
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:31,920
 You have the same blood. 

1052
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:34,520
 You grew up together. 

1053
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:39,160
 But you couldn't recognize Osman, babe. 

1054
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:46,940
 Osman is not a valiant who will stop with grip and go with push. 

1055
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:52,820
 Whatever he did was his own courage ... 

1056
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:55,240
 ... with his own consent. 

1057
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,840
 Obviously you came here full. 

1058
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:08,200
 You don't say no, you speak badly. 

1059
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:11,260
 If you don't have another word to say ... 

1060
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:14,320
 ... put me alone. 

1061
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:17,680
 I said I'd say! 

1062
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:25,740
 Now, take the curse you brought, go away from our obesity! 

1063
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,740
 There is no place I did not look at, sir. 

1064
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:49,140
 There is no Literary, nor Bala Hatun. 

1065
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:51,200
 Tursun? 

1066
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:52,980
 I looked at the hospital, sir ... 

1067
02:13:53,420 --> 02:13:54,460
 Tursun is gone. 

1068
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:06,700
 Inform the Alps and get them ready. We're going to the New Market. 

1069
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:21,480
 I brought you a vaccine in the morning. 

1070
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:25,760
 Thank you, Aygül Hatun. I need to get a thesis. 

1071
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:32,080
 Are you going to follow that line? 

1072
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:35,260
 I would like to know why they went without saying anything. 

1073
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,100
 Don't go, Osman! 

1074
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:45,940
 You went once, we did not come to our troubles. 

1075
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,400
 What do you say, Aygül Hatun? 

1076
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:50,860
 He is a chick. 

1077
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:54,680
 No will not come to you from him! 

1078
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:59,080
 It is because of all the gay things that have happened to us. 

1079
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,440
 All that happened to us ... 

1080
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:06,120
 ... Aygül Hatun, arrogant and arrogance of your father and his grandfather. 

1081
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:09,860
 This is how you memorize it! 

1082
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:05,000
 You'll wait for me here. 

1083
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:11,680
 The Edebali? 

1084
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:25,340
 I've never seen my brain like this. 

1085
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:30,500
 Osman Bey was blind when he couldn't see Edebalı and Tursun at the place. 

1086
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:33,860
 Not that. 

1087
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:35,280
 What is the reason? 

1088
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:40,200
 Osman Bey's eyes were dark when he could not find Bala Hatun. 

1089
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:45,840
 I know. 

1090
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,660
 This is love. 

1091
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,060
 Osman Bey's heart fell into love fire. 

1092
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:03,600
 (Coughs.) 

1093
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:07,260
 I'm Samsa. 

1094
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:11,380
 What do you know love? 

1095
02:19:12,620 --> 02:19:17,140
 Didn't you find love in gas, in futuhat? 

1096
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:29,400
 Aren't you married to your pusat, Samsa Sergeant, huh? 

1097
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:36,860
 What happened? 

1098
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:39,460
 Your eyes are cloudy. 

1099
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,020
 Your heart was black. 

1100
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,040
 Well ... 

1101
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:48,920
 What is it, sir, who dips you away? 

1102
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:53,160
 Don't worry, my heart and your carcass! 

1103
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:14,920
 Samsa Sergeant ... 

1104
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:18,880
 ... we are informal garbage brothers with this. 

1105
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:21,880
 Didn't we go down to the lair of the shroud? 

1106
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:25,660
 Didn't we shed the blood of the shrouds together? 

1107
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:29,940
 There is no secret hidden between us. 

1108
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:31,660
 Tell me. 

1109
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:35,700
 I worry about Osman Bey. 

1110
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,860
 Why am I Samsa Bey? 

1111
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:46,920
 Boran Alp, which you call love ... 

1112
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:51,040
 ... blunt the brain principality, the sword of the brave. 

1113
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:54,520
 How do you know this? 

1114
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:05,900
 Or did you burn with love fire for a while, Samsa Sergeant? 

1115
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:11,440
 What word to burn! 

1116
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:16,500
 Tell me then, we are your garbage. 

1117
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:19,420
 Have a go for your job! 

1118
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,500
 [Thriller music.] 

1119
02:22:11,920 --> 02:23:33,160
 [Generic music.] 

1120

1
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:13,335
 Get out! 

2
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,865
 The Angle! Get out! The Angle! 

3
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,080
 Calm down! 

4
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
 The Angle! The Angle! 

5
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,160
 Get out! 

6
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,860
 Get out! 

7
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,100
 Open the way! 

8
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
 Open the way! 

9
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:23,705
 Get out! 

10
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:30,435
 Answer my questions. 

11
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,155
 I'll take care of you having saved my life. 

12
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,580
 What are you doing here? 

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,460
 Did you kill Tekfur? 

14
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,460
 What Tekfur? What to kill? 

15
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:53,365
 As a Turk, what are you doing here? 

16
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,180
 You would have killed him more. 

17
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,900
 Ertuğrul's son Osman ... 

18
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,360
 What the hell are you doing? 

19
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:27,645
 Where did you come from now? 

20
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,665
 Ertuğrul Bey's son ... 

21
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,480
 ... famous Osman he? 

22
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,560
 It is a fire like his father. 

23
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,315
 Kurt from his father ... 

24
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,140
 ... they say they're wolves. 

25
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,280
 See your duty, I will take care of it. 

26
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,120
 Job was twenty-six to seven ... 

27
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,375
 Job was twenty-six to seven ... 

28
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,780
 That ... 

29
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,100
 ... over the void ... 

30
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,660
 ... spreads the north ... 

31
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,700
 ... on nothingness ... 

32
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,880
 ... the world ... 

33
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 ... wand! 

34
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,715
 [One hundred and forty-eight ...] 

35
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:24,885
 [...three...] 

36
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,295
 [... glorify him ...] 

37
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:32,235
 [...Sun and moon...] 

38
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,075
 ... all the shining stars. 

39
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,065
 Six in four. 

40
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,120
 Vast waters ... 

41
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,660
 ... you put on clothes like clothes. 

42
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,100
 And the waters ... 

43
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,500
 was standing on the mountains. 

44
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,900
 Endless thanks to my Lord. 

45
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,540
 Allahu akbar. 

46
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,700
 Allahu akbar. 

47
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,160
 Allahu akbar. 

48
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,260
 Allahu akbar. 

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
 Allahu akbar. 

50
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,900
 Allahu akbar. 

51
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,000
 Our master said ... 

52
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,120
 ... we have to find the trust. 

53
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,875
 I found! 

54
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,685
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

55
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,200
 Inna fetahna ... 

56
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,220
 ... stain fethan mubina. 

57
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
 Praise. 

58
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:50,355
 Thank God. 

59
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,160
 Since Tekfur is dead, there is fuss everywhere. 

60
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,500
 Time is tight, let's hurry. 

61
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,880
 We have to draw up a thesis. 

62
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
 Either bismillah! 

63
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,080
 You did not take care of your Tekfur. 

64
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,205
 You buried her own palace on her. 

65
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,760
 Goddamn commanders like you. 

66
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,440
 None of you are like Osman! 

67
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,425
 Damn it. 

68
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:39,375
 Answer! 

69
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,325
 How can you not take precautions? 

70
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:45,055
 How? 

71
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,500
 There is no traitor in this castle to mean the life of our Tekfur. 

72
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,840
 We were his sons. 

73
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:57,685
 We would give our own lives and protect him. 

74
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,460
 We will question everyone in the castle. 

75
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,220
 We will make everyone speak one by one. 

76
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:05,295
 Where was Tekfur last? 

77
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:08,675
 Who was he with? We will learn them all. 

78
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,845
 He was in his last room. 

79
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:15,125
 I sent him to his room to call Helen. 

80
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,680
 After I told Tekfur our invitation, 

81
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,140
 ... acted. 

82
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:25,765
 But before he got into his room ... 

83
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:29,455
 ... I saw Ertuğrul's son Osman leaving his room. 

84
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,395
 What did you say? 

85
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
 Are you sure it's Osman? 

86
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,680
 Yes sir. 

87
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,100
 The son I saw was Ertuğrul's son Osman. 

88
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:38,595
 Osman... 

89
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,260
 Bring the bottom of the castle immediately, Andreas. 

90
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,540
 Mobilize all commanders. 

91
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,360
 Look for the castle! 

92
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,105
 Lets. 

93
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,440
 I hear footsteps. 

94
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,740
 Do not worry. 

95
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:25,385
 It will recover soon. 

96
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,965
 He has a heart to challenge sentence world. 

97
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:32,035
 He will take care of his head. Lets. 

98
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,900
 May you be entrusted to Allah. 

99
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,500
 Lets! 

100
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,080
 [Come on hurry!] 

101
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,500
 Run, run fast! Run, run! 

102
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,800
 Let's! Hurry up! 

103
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,560
 Quickly! 

104
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,400
 Notify the commanders! 

105
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,320
 Osman infiltrated the castle. Did you kill Tekfur? 

106
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,575
 I promise you. 

107
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,540
 I will find Osman ... 

108
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,720
 ... and we will handle everything. 

109
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,280
 I told you that the stars will help us tonight. 

110
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,360
 Commander Kalanoz! 

111
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,360
 Commander Kalanoz! 

112
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,700
 Osman's starry room in Sofia! 

113
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,360
 Star room? 

114
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,420
 I will catch him, Sofia. 

115
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,900
 What is Osman doing there? 

116
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,100
 Holy relics! 

117
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,040
 You killed our Tekfur, vile dog! 

118
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,920
 Tekfur's executioner ... 

119
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,520
 ... the most innocent of you. 

120
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,480
 Running! 

121
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,720
 Get Osman! 

122
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,480
 Catch without leaving the castle! 

123
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,280
 Running! 

124
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,560
 Damn it! We would have missed it. 

125
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,720
 (The bells are ringing.) 

126
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,060
 Where did you stay, sir? 

127
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,300
 Where are you, sir? 

128
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,720
 Mr. Bey, take this, drink water. 

129
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,240
 I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine 

130
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,660
 I was worried about you when the bells rang. 

131
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,660
 Tekfur is dead. 

132
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,540
 The murder remained on me. 

133
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,000
 How about you sir? 

134
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,160
 We need to find a place to take refuge as soon as possible. 

135
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,160
 Let's go to Mario's carpenter, where we shop before, sir. 

136
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
 You have a good mind. 

137
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,940
 Don't say to those who say stop! 

138
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,360
 Steal the sword! 

139
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,040
 Thank you! 

140
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,580
 Lets! 

141
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:05,325
 They took the treasure and the sacred trust. 

142
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:06,955
 Damn! 

143
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:13,405
 My God disaster my sins. 

144
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,465
 Send news to master Yannis now. 

145
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:18,885
 Sofia ... 

146
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:20,715
 ... Master Yannis ... 

147
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:23,305
 ... it pays us both. 

148
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,120
 How will we look at the face of master Yannis? 

149
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,480
 Ha! 

150
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,480
 This sadness collapsed into our heart without rejoicing in the conception of Tekfur. 

151
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 Osman. 

152
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,000
 I will remove your liver with my own teeth. 

153
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,640
 Osman! 

154
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,620
 Obviously no one has seen us. 

155
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,880
 No incoming and outgoing. 

156
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,680
 When I meet our Sheikh, I will pray immediately. 

157
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,160
 You should leave early in the morning. 

158
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,385
 Won't you come? 

159
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,585
 Cenk is just starting, girl. 

160
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:29,525
 Those who serve the devil will act. 

161
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:32,925
 Tekfur was also killed, and there will be a lot of confusion here. 

162
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,645
 Is Osman saved? 

163
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:38,785
 What if he couldn't get away? 

164
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:44,205
 Thank goodness to my Lord. 

165
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,235
 Ahi universe ... 

166
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,495
 ... we found the treasure that came to the hands of the enemy. 

167
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,900
 We have the blessed trust of the Yesevi Holiness now. 

168
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,320
 Thank god. 

169
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,795
 Bey gnaws at me. 

170
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
 Who killed Tekfur? 

171
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,120
 I don't know, brother. 

172
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
 I do not know. 

173
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:37,345
 But there is only one thing I know. 

174
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,520
 He is also the one nearest to Tekfur killed. 

175
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,480
 You have a right, sir. 

176
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,120
 Snakes in Tekfur's bosom. 

177
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,940
 Why did they kill him? 

178
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,880
 Because it delights us. 

179
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,380
 They couldn't digest it. 

180
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,945
 They want to finish peace and re-fight. 

181
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,220
 Who would those bastards be? 

182
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,680
 Since they had such a vile assassination ... 

183
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,055
 must be a secret organization. 

184
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:07,145
 His arms spread all over Bitinya ... 

185
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,280
 ... a secret organization. 

186
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,560
 They took the opportunity to have my father in Konya and started an assault. 

187
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,000
 Let's ask your account then, sir. 

188
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,900
 Kalanoz will already fly. 

189
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,840
 Their intention is to shoot fire from me. 

190
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
 My brothers... 

191
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,175
 ... we are under fire from both sides. 

192
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,505
 Nun dressed as a nun ... 

193
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:32,935
 ... our salvation is this chick. 

194
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,440
 If we find him, we will find Tekfur's murderers ... 

195
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,080
 ... traitors in the castle. 

196
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:49,965
 Did you find that devil? 

197
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:53,040
 The place was split, as if the antichrist entered Turkey. 

198
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,180
 Unless we catch Osman, there is no peace in this land! 

199
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,520
 I will find him! 

200
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,480
 I swear by God that I will find it and kill it with my own hands. 

201
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,060
 It is not easy to find it. 

202
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,145
 He must come with his own foot. 

203
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:10,925
 How? 

204
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,900
 He is a Turk who reveals his own life in order not to kill Tekfur. 

205
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,240
 If we take one of your own blood from your own life ... 

206
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,460
 will surrender to save him. 

207
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,260
 Tonight the devil has taken over the whole castle. 

208
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,720
 Sometimes he needs help from the devil to survive. 

209
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,560
 We will receive a deposit from Dündar Bey. 

210
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:58,845
 And this trust is ... 

211
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:02,515
 ... will take Osman out of the well he avoids. 

212
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,855
 And because of Osman ... 

213
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,175
 ... there will be a big fire. 

214
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,185
 I will send my most trusted man. 

215
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:19,535
 Dündar Bey will be very angry with this situation. 

216
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,135
 And the deal will be broken. 

217
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:27,155
 Agreement ... 

218
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:31,805
 ... mercilessly murdered our Tekfur ... 

219
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:34,255
 ... Son of Ertuğrul broke Osman. 

220
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,140
 Everyone should hear that Osman committed this murder. 

221
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,860
 And he should believe. 

222
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,820
 Everyone should know how the apiaries treat their friends. 

223
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,100
 [Is there a desturi?] 

224
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,740
 Come to Gündüz Bey. 

225
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,920
 Is there still no news from the Ottomans? 

226
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:35,205
 The turnout that we did not look at, the nook that we did not enter, is not sure. 

227
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,820
 But futile. 

228
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,700
 What does he want to do? 

229
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,765
 Where does he want to arrive? I don't mind. 

230
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:45,240
 Moment, ointment is applied to our wound like a doctor. 

231
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,500
 It happens ... 

232
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,360
 ... put salt on our wound like an adversary. 

233
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,760
 Dundar Bey came out of this job desire. 

234
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,580
 Ertuğrul Gazi should also know what happened. 

235
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,500
 You should send a letter to our Ertuğrul Bey explaining everything that is going on in the oba. 

236
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,700
 You should act as news of Osman, who does not listen. 

237
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,880
 My aunt speaks the truth. 

238
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,640
 Now to my father on his horse ... 

239
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,380
 ... if he walks into the room ... 

240
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,580
 ... if Osman asked where ... 

241
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,180
 what do we call him? 

242
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,380
 Oh Osman ah ... 

243
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,300
 Look at what you dropped me? 

244
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:39,515
 So what... 

245
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,985
 ... you left no other way. 

246
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:45,925
 You did not leave. 

247
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,580
 Selamun aleyküm Dündar Bey. 

248
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,560
 Hello, hello. 

249
00:24:58,645 --> 00:24:59,640
 Mr. Bamsı. 

250
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,300
 Here Basin. 

251
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,380
 Thank you. 

252
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,200
 May you exist, Dundar Bey. 

253
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,740
 Osman, Dundar Bey ... 

254
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,120
 Where is ...? 

255
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:39,925
 There has been a good time, but Osman is not in the middle. 

256
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:45,085
 Jackals are looking for opportunities to suck blood. 

257
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:47,535
 Osman too ... 

258
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,155
 ... they should not hunt like Aybaham. 

259
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:54,905
 We were going to ask you, Bamsı Bey. 

260
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:58,805
 I am not a son, son. Bey is Dündar Bey. 

261
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,895
 It is necessary to be aware of the flying bird and the blowing wind. 

262
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,620
 If a situation happened to Osman ... 

263
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:12,980
 ... How about Ertuğrul Bey? 

264
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,740
 HE? 

265
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,720
 Brother Day! 

266
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:21,285
 HE? 

267
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,245
 Emmi Dündar! 

268
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:26,615
 Bey. 

269
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:39,655
 Erewhile... 

270
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:42,345
 ... even if Ertuğrul Bey came ... 

271
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:44,825
 ... this bond is fine ... 

272
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,120
 ... if it is in order. 

273
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,165
 Immediately! 

274
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,715
 Let Gündüz Bey send the Alps to Osman. 

275
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,360
 They should not come without a trace. 

276
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,700
 Will you send the letter, sir? 

277
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,485
 I say to you, Mr. 

278
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,775
 What should I say to my brother? 

279
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:46,195
 What can i say? 

280
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:49,555
 Can I say I couldn't take care of an Osman? 

281
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,020
 Osman could not take care of ... 

282
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,720
 ... how can I take care of it, brother? 

283
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,300
 Is Tekfur Yorgo Polos dead? 

284
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,460
 Yes sir. 

285
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,860
 So why is your voice as cold as the snow on Mount Olympus? 

286
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,340
 The messenger sent by Sir Sofia brought you a letter. 

287
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,240
 Read. 

288
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,500
 Read Read Megala! 

289
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,980
 What does it say in the letter? 

290
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:33,225
 Sir. 

291
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,500
 Sacred relics and treasure were stolen from the magic chamber. 

292
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,160
 Everything that happened when Yorgo Polos was killed. 

293
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:45,445
 Who knew the location of the secret room where the secret was hidden? 

294
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:48,645
 How did they learn it, Megala? How? 

295
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:51,465
 Who did it? 

296
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,445
 Osman, the son of Ertuğrul Gazi. 

297
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,520
 A Turk of goatsherd ruined everything. 

298
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
 Osman! 

299
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,380
 Osman, Osman, Osman! 

300
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,020
 Prepare my horse. 

301
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
 We go to Kulucahisar Castle. 

302
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,140
 Yes, sir. 

303
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,085
 What happened to this shop? 

304
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:27,405
 Everywhere is confused. 

305
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,000
 Ugh! 

306
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,060
 In this period, you will not even trust your assistant. 

307
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,365
 May God punish you all. 

308
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,220
 Who are you? 

309
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
 What are you looking for in this shop? 

310
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,200
 I'm sorry, master. 

311
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,440
 You will work for us today. 

312
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,500
 Let's finish this job. 

313
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,440
 Thank you sir. 

314
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,180
 The car is ready. 

315
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:34,065
 It's time to set off. 

316
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:36,340
 They will wait for you outside the castle. 

317
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:40,200
 I assigned the soldiers at the gate of the castle. 

318
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,125
 If you stop and ask ... 

319
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,760
 ... don't sound. 

320
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,660
 Those soldiers will save you. 

321
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,540
 May Allah and help you, Dursun Bey. 

322
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:54,335
 May my Lord make you victorious in this cruel homeland. 

323
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:56,235
 May there be my daughter. 

324
00:31:58,135 --> 00:31:59,395
 May you exist. 

325
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:06,035
 I respectfully bless my master's blessed hands. 

326
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:11,555
 Do not make your prayer lacking this poor. 

327
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:13,285
 Himmat to ... 

328
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,200
 ... we need your breath ... 

329
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,520
 ... message here. 

330
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:26,545
 Dursun Efendi. 

331
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:31,225
 Is there any news from Osman? 

332
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:41,975
 For now it has not been found. 

333
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:45,165
 Ertuğrul's son Osman ... 

334
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:50,385
 ... nobody knows when and where to go. 

335
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,060
 God help you, Dursun Bey. 

336
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,060
 Amine. 

337
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,400
 May Allah help you. 

338
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,660
 O people! 

339
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,960
 Last night... 

340
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,360
 Our Tekfur, Yorgo Polos ... 

341
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,565
 ... it has been murdered! 

342
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:35,195
 God... 

343
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,140
 ... take him to his paradise. 

344
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,460
 The killer of our Tekfur is made of apricots. 

345
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,520
 Ertuğrul Bey's son ... 

346
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,160
 ... is Osman Bey. 

347
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,380
 The murderer of our Tekfur ... 

348
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,800
 ... is Osman Bey! 

349
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,980
 We know that killer is inside us. 

350
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,940
 Whoever helps him ... 

351
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,060
 ... with his family ... 

352
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,980
 ... will be his life. 

353
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,160
 Our Tekfur'u ... 

354
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,960
 ... George Polos ... 

355
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
 Stop the coachman! 

356
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,440
 What is in the car? 

357
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,840
 There is extra virgin olive oil. 

358
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,140
 Open it and let's see. 

359
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,485
 Let it not see the daylight. 

360
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
 My soldier will be wasted. 

361
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,080
 This is olive oil ... 

362
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,780
 Come on! 

363
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,780
 Do not doubt that you will not starve me in the winter. 

364
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,800
 I said open to you! 

365
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,740
 I have a child, I don't have a soldier. 

366
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
 What if I'm hungry? 

367
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,520
 Let go. 

368
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,700
 We're not going to find Osman in a barrel of olive oil. 

369
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:07,975
 Let's! Wait, man! 

370
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,855
 May God forgive you for your children. 

371
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:28,295
 Open the door! 

372
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,485
 [God thank you. Victory is ours.] 

373
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,220
 We are near the church, sir. Shall we come with you? 

374
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,640
 You do my duty. 

375
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:37,315
 I will enter the church alone. See you at Mayramushane. 

376
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:38,545
 Thank you sir. 

377
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:16,765
 Come easy, pastor. 

378
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:24,305
 Welcome to God's house. 

379
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:26,645
 Jesus' mighty warrior. 

380
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:28,955
 I wish every person ... 

381
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,840
 If Jesus had the strength to endure suffering like our Lord. 

382
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,680
 Prophets are embodied in faith. 

383
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,455
 Being like our Lord of Jesus ... 

384
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:45,485
 ... is not easy. 

385
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:51,655
 How lucky are you priest master? 

386
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,605
 In the heart of such a temple for years ... 

387
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,560
 ... away from sins, scum ... 

388
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,620
 ... you had a lifetime. 

389
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,340
 This is the first time I have seen you in this church. 

390
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,040
 Because I am coming for the first time. 

391
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:11,875
 Do you know the faces of every person from your community? 

392
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,740
 In this age, the congregations of our churches have decreased considerably. 

393
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,380
 Most of them because of the Turks ... 

394
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,365
 ... chose to become a Muslim. 

395
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:23,565
 Every now and then, old men come. 

396
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:26,105
 When I see our young people ... 

397
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:27,560
 ... I'm not chasing them. 

398
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,300
 So I couldn't recognize you. 

399
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:32,655
 I'm looking for a nun. 

400
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,825
 He's important to me. 

401
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:40,605
 Maybe I can help if you say your name. 

402
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:41,965
 I do not know your name. 

403
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,260
 How can I help you if you do not know your name? 

404
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,700
 Black-eyed ... 

405
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:52,295
 ... hazel eyes ... 

406
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,820
 ... these sizes. 

407
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,600
 There are so many nuns in that shape scheme, son ... 

408
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,640
 What is the secret in the nun who chases you so much? 

409
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,140
 The debt of life. 

410
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,715
 I would like to pay my debt. 

411
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,775
 Face ... 

412
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:20,515
 ... little freckles adorn it? 

413
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:33,095
 Yeah. 

414
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,660
 You are talking about Nevadoka, the Virgin Mary of our church. 

415
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,600
 Outside that city ... 

416
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,200
 he lives in a temple. 

417
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,220
 You... 

418
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,060
 ... I'll describe it. 

419
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,600
 Are you sure? 

420
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,360
 Look, son. 

421
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,575
 Now listen to me. 

422
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:54,345
 Burcin. 

423
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:09,905
 Enough is enough. 

424
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,600
 Anger inside first poisons you. Don't you see? 

425
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,600
 First of all, Aybars are now strings. 

426
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,440
 Who knows how he got them into trouble? 

427
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:24,165
 The taste of the salt is no more because of it. 

428
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,375
 Who knows how many more valiant blood will Osman Osman, Aygül? 

429
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,545
 You still worry about it. 

430
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,895
 You eat yourself. 

431
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,680
 Can't you see how the real Osman poisoned you? 

432
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,300
 One day there will be a big trouble for you too. 

433
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:48,345
 I know. 

434
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:51,075
 You hurt a lot. 

435
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:55,565
 You will experience your pain until you soak. 

436
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:57,655
 But... 

437
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,640
 ... forgetting the divinity and ... 

438
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,040
 ... you blame Osman. 

439
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,200
 The trouble that will come to me from Osman ... 

440
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,600
 ... I count honor. 

441
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:10,075
 You know. 

442
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:14,165
 I know for sure. 

443
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:16,845
 Aybars is a martyr. 

444
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:21,965
 However, this does not cover Osman Bey's insensitivity. 

445
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,655
 There is no so-called pilgrimage. If... 

446
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,320
 ... one day your liver burns like me ... 

447
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,160
 then you will realize my words. 

448
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,360
 Come on easy. 

449
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,805
 Burçin Hatun! 

450
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:37,615
 Burçin Hatun! 

451
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:41,105
 Plead. 

452
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:37,705
 Here is Dundar's daughter. 

453
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:40,975
 Let's finish this job before the guards wake up. 

454
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:42,635
 Let's. 

455
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:57,385
 You still hate Osman. 

456
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,620
 Remember that he went to avenge the man you loved. 

457
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,020
 Aygül took it away from me. 

458
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,215
 You still call me revenge. 

459
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,740
 Just as it burns my heart, it will also burn your heart when the day comes. 

460
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:29,575
 What do you want? 

461
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,440
 What are you doing here? 

462
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,220
 Osman killed our Tekfur. 

463
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,680
 He was trapped in the castle like a mouse. 

464
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,040
 We need a feed to get him out of the hole he's stuck in. 

465
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:44,355
 You are Aygül Hatun. 

466
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:42,455
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

467
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,355
 When you say be ... 

468
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,640
 ... filling our hearts with the light of faith ... 

469
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,280
 ... by ninety-nine names of Allah Almighty. 

470
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:00,635
 Ali Oğuz's ... 

471
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:02,585
 ... valiant gentlemen. 

472
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:07,165
 Ahval in Bitinya is well known to all of you. 

473
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:09,335
 My brother... 

474
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,020
 ... these lands we came under the banner of Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

475
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,220
 ... captivates your fertile face from us. 

476
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,020
 Non... 

477
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:20,305
 ... can no longer carry us. 

478
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,040
 This past time ... 

479
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,040
 ... both our men and ... 

480
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:28,345
 ... our flocks have increased. 

481
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:30,365
 In every oba ... 

482
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,280
 ... there were many troubles in all sizes. 

483
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,060
 Some of us have water. 

484
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:41,765
 Some of us have little grass. 

485
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,125
 Bandit ... 

486
00:46:43,405 --> 00:46:46,635
 ... the caravan, and the joke. 

487
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,615
 That is why ... 

488
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,300
 ... an ointment to our wounds, our troubles ... 

489
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,760
 ... we looked for a remedy. 

490
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,720
 That remedy ... 

491
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,795
 ... the alliance. 

492
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:06,655
 The extract ... 

493
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:08,565
 ... Our neighbors ... 

494
00:47:09,095 --> 00:47:11,685
 ... Kulucahisar Tekfur with Yorgo Polos ... 

495
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,965
 ... we sealed a trade agreement. 

496
00:47:14,825 --> 00:47:16,065
 Both they ... 

497
00:47:16,455 --> 00:47:19,195
 ... and we will win. 

498
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,760
 In the new market rather than in willow ... 

499
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,740
 .. all of our goods will be sold. 

500
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,560
 Very good, thank goodness. 

501
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,000
 Come on, Samsa Bey. 

502
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,935
 You look like you're not very satisfied. 

503
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,285
 Mr. Dundar. 

504
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:47,475
 My brother, you say ... 

505
00:47:48,475 --> 00:47:51,895
 ... Ertuğrul Gazi did not come to this end by paying a maple. 

506
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:55,235
 Not us, too. 

507
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:58,465
 ... brought us to the heart of the tub like a spear. 

508
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:00,965
 Beyond that ... 

509
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:04,385
 ... we add it to this land, not a caravan ... 

510
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:06,445
 ... under the shadow of wolf-head bricks ... 

511
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:08,595
 We came to give order to the world. 

512
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:11,805
 Behold ... 

513
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:15,035
 ... is not friendly to us from Küffar. 

514
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:23,085
 The Beech ... 

515
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,095
 ... valiant gentleman Samsa. 

516
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,860
 I know how your heart will beat when it comes to gas and cenk. 

517
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,700
 But do not forget. 

518
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:38,225
 The dorm is taken with pusat but ... 

519
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:39,735
 ... detached ... 

520
00:48:40,495 --> 00:48:42,135
 ... is not installed with pusat. 

521
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:45,965
 What you call Nizam ... 

522
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:47,935
 ... like maple ... 

523
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:50,065
 ... needs intelligence ... 

524
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:51,875
 ... wants trick. 

525
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,905
 Dunsa Bey does not want the informal out of the gas. 

526
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,935
 Not gas to you ... 

527
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:02,685
 ... order is required, Samsa Bey. 

528
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:04,305
 Slots cooker ... 

529
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:06,785
 ... cookers oba ... 

530
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,020
 ... the camps become dorm. 

531
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,680
 How many times have I said to let you take a head ... 

532
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,535
 ... you've never been there. 

533
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,380
 I've been fighting since the day I put that black pusat on my waist. 

534
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,620
 I filled the eagle bushes, I quilt the sky quilts. 

535
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:44,905
 I became friends with Şahan and derttaş and burrito. 

536
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:48,095
 I know his bravery and howliness Dundar Bey. 

537
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,220
 But when Cenk is mentioned, the half of Samsa, who runs mad foals, is ... 

538
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,740
 ... this is his companion. 

539
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,800
 That's how it is known. 

540
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,465
 I drank and gave me a tribute. 

541
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:07,955
 My wedding is with this. 

542
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:11,155
 My wedding ... 

543
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:12,935
 ... şahadetl to. 

544
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,960
 Because we allied our pusat ... 

545
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,480
 ... we didn't set it aside, Samsa Bey. 

546
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,020
 You be the text. 

547
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,560
 Treaty with Tekfur ... 

548
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,520
 ... will bring peace to everyone. 

549
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,440
 There is no peace where we are not Gündüz Bey. 

550
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:23,295
 Still haven't learned? 

551
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:32,495
 You work ... 

552
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,800
 ... you bring peace. You are welcome. Alişar Bey. 

553
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,520
 We saw it, we did not hear it. 

554
00:51:48,995 --> 00:51:49,995
 Mr. Dundar. 

555
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,540
 Unaware of the starboard brain .... 

556
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:56,680
 ... you made a deal with Tekfur. 

557
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,405
 So many sizes ... 

558
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:14,355
 ... so many oba ... 

559
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:17,685
 ... in which way do we settle down? 

560
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,340
 Do not you know that I am the shadow of the sultan in this land? 

561
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,060
 Alişar Bey, you are good luck. 

562
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:31,915
 We do not forget the order or respect, evelallah. 

563
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:40,575
 Your door ... 

564
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:43,625
 ... not the curvature gate ... 

565
00:52:44,555 --> 00:52:46,535
 Alişar Bey is the door of truth. 

566
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:50,845
 First of all, we have taken care of our roughness ... 

567
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:53,345
 ... we were going to knock your door ... 

568
00:52:53,575 --> 00:52:55,505
 ... you acted before us. 

569
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,360
 [Let me see Dündar Bey!] 

570
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,880
 What is going on there? 

571
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
 Mr. Dundar! 

572
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,380
 Burcin! 

573
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,080
 Burçin my daughter! 

574
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,220
 Burçin my daughter! 

575
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,160
 What is this? 

576
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,160
 What happened to you? 

577
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,140
 Who did this? 

578
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,200
 Drink water, drink water, drink water. 

579
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,200
 Which bloodless hand raised you? 

580
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,340
 Vote. 

581
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:21,225
 Father. 

582
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,940
 Andreas, commander of Kalanoz. 

583
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,820
 They kidnapped Aygül. 

584
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,220
 How about you girl? 

585
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,740
 How dare you? Where did they miss? 

586
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,940
 They stepped on washing clothes in the creek, sir. 

587
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,820
 They took Aygül by force. 

588
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,980
 They let me know that I should let you know. 

589
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,720
 What do they want? 

590
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,560
 Well, girl, talk. What do they want? 

591
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
 Osman. 

592
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,340
 They want Osman. 

593
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,600
 They call you for this, sir. 

594
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,960
 Osman? 

595
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,880
 He killed Osman Tekfur. 

596
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:52,635
 They look for him in the castle. 

597
00:53:52,635 --> 00:53:55,415
 They took Aygül hostage so that Osman could appear. 

598
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,120
 My Osman, my Osman must have gone to the castle to find the killers of my Aybars. 

599
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,260
 Dundar Bey obviously found Osman a clue. 

600
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,000
 That's why they look for him. 

601
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,640
 Emmi. 

602
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,165
 Let's catch up with the thesis before Osman and Aygül have anything to happen. 

603
00:54:18,165 --> 00:54:21,505
 In the daytime, be ready for war with the gentlemen. 

604
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,560
 We are going to the castle with Bamsı Bey. 

605
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,780
 If we do not return from that castle, stone on stone ... 

606
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,080
 ... don't leave a head on the shoulder. 

607
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,260
 I said to him that he would not be a friendly friend. 

608
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,300
 There is no waiting, I will come too. 

609
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,880
 You know best from the language of the Shroud. 

610
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:42,795
 Lets. 

611
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:44,305
 Mr. Dundar! 

612
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:49,565
 Where do you go alone while the starboard is standing? 

613
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:52,375
 Let's take the necessary precaution first ... 

614
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,125
 ... let's notify our sultan. 

615
00:54:55,415 --> 00:54:56,415
 We ... 

616
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,980
 ... honor dear ... 

617
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,580
 blood is washed with blood. 

618
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,980
 I don't have time to wait. 

619
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,275
 You should do your duty as sancak bey ... 

620
00:55:06,275 --> 00:55:09,345
 ... as a father, as an immigrant ... 

621
00:55:09,795 --> 00:55:11,075
 ... do what you need. 

622
00:55:12,335 --> 00:55:13,615
 With permission. 

623
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,240
 Look at Osman, the hunter head of Karaya. 

624
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:40,020
 We went all the hunts, never saw the target surprised. 

625
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:44,245
 He must have watched Aybars' murderer step by step. 

626
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,700
 Let's see. 

627
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,220
 What will happen after this job? 

628
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,175
 Our informal direction is obvious. 

629
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:05,145
 The information we will get from where we went ... 

630
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,325
 ... will take us to the murderers of my brother Aybars. 

631
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:10,085
 Ertuğrul Bey's son Osman! 

632
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,660
 I know you heard me that you were in the castle! 

633
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,060
 I also know that you killed Tekfur. 

634
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:23,975
 Aygul. 

635
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,680
 We have witnesses! 

636
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,780
 Aygül, daughter of Dündar Bey, is in our hands. 

637
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,405
 To surrender to you ... 

638
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:43,300
 ... I give it one last chance. 

639
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,020
 Surrender to Commander Kalanoz now! Or Dundar Bey's daughter ... 

640
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,700
 ... will be out of your head! 

641
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,735
 We also sent news to Dündar Bey. 

642
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:59,035
 He will come to the castle sooner or later to take his daughter. 

643
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,125
 If you do not surrender ... 

644
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,180
 ... we will kill him when he arrives. 

645
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,480
 Tell Osman to come and surrender. 

646
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:20,025
 Get up! 

647
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
 Osman! 

648
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,440
 Don't surrender, Osman! 

649
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,640
 Shut up! 

650
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,040
 Sir, sir, stop. 

651
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,180
 My time is not anger time. 

652
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,020
 We must act. 

653
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,740
 [Osman!] 

654
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,360
 [Osman this is my last warning to you!] 

655
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,540
 Get up! 

656
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,100
 Get up! 

657
00:58:06,685 --> 00:58:07,685
 Come here! 

658
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,300
 Surrender to Commander Kalanoz immediately. 

659
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,380
 If you don't surrender ... 

660
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:15,545
 ... the beautiful head of Aygül ... 

661
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,820
 ... will break from your body! 

662
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,080
 Walk! 

663
00:58:24,135 --> 00:58:26,475
 If I don't put this castle in them grave ... 

664
00:58:27,185 --> 00:58:30,245
 ... they should not tell me the son of Ertuğrul, Osman. 

665
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:32,845
 What are we going to do, sir? 

666
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:35,975
 Now is the time to get bounty. 

667
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:40,005
 We will make these lands narrow for the traitors. 

668
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,300
 Listen to me well. 

669
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,640
 My wife Yorgo Polos ... 

670
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,380
 ... not only Tekfur of this castle ... 

671
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,220
 ... was the protector of all of us. 

672
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:22,205
 But we couldn't protect it. 

673
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:25,715
 We sacrificed him to a murder. 

674
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,765
 We will organize the funeral tomorrow. 

675
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,400
 Has news been delivered to everyone in the region? 

676
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:34,455
 The reporters are on their way, sir. 

677
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:42,640
 This is the beginning of a war that will never end with the Turks. 

678
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,000
 Increase the measures in the whole castle. 

679
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,580
 To find volunteers who want to fight in our rank ... 

680
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,340
 ... act! 

681
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,520
 Before I take my husband's revenge from those Turks ... 

682
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,380
 I can't even breathe. 

683
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,900
 When the kalanoz comes to you ... 

684
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,600
 ... I appoint you as my deputy. 

685
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:39,880
 Moreover, with the privilege of using all the powers that belong to me. 

686
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,180
 You can be sure that I will be worthy of your trust. 

687
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,745
 You can come out. 

688
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,380
 Now... 

689
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,520
 ... to me, Kalanoz. Joyful... 

690
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,800
 what do you think you're doing? 

691
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,640
 How dare you come to obama like a coyote ... 

692
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,020
 ... you kidnap my daughter? 

693
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,480
 I am the son of Süleyman Shah ... 

694
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,620
 Mr. Dundar! 

695
01:01:27,155 --> 01:01:28,155
 You... 

696
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,020
 Who will protect me from wrath? 

697
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,160
 Who will protect it? Are they paying? 

698
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,100
 Demirkapilar? 

699
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,800
 Are the soldiers you stack up on the door? 

700
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,260
 Who is he? 

701
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,200
 Bring my daughter. 

702
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,560
 Immediately! 

703
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,860
 Do you threaten me in my pen, Dundar Bey? 

704
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,400
 It's not in your castle. 

705
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:54,825
 In the castle of my friend Yorgo Polos. 

706
01:01:58,195 --> 01:02:01,015
 I warn you, Kalanoz. 

707
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,960
 The threat is the job of the helpless. 

708
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,400
 George Polos, whom I see as my father ... 

709
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,560
 ... because you're your friend, now in a coffin? 

710
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,260
 My commander! 

711
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,640
 What will you say ... 

712
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:14,325
 ... say it directly. 

713
01:02:16,055 --> 01:02:18,145
 You can not laugh. 

714
01:02:18,545 --> 01:02:20,135
 Osman killed him. 

715
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:23,265
 Yorgo Polos' friend ... 

716
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:25,835
 ... Dundar Bey's nephew Osman! 

717
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,880
 When we come for the deal ... 

718
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,700
 ... if Osman was not in the square ... 

719
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,880
 ... Tekfur that coffin ... 

720
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,160
 ... would enter before. 

721
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,860
 We know that Osman is in the castle. 

722
01:02:42,565 --> 01:02:44,435
 If it is innocent ... 

723
01:02:44,775 --> 01:02:47,335
 ... we want to prove it. 

724
01:02:48,145 --> 01:02:50,205
 If we had a caste ... 

725
01:02:51,095 --> 01:02:53,885
 ... we would do the evil we want to Aygül. 

726
01:02:54,935 --> 01:02:55,935
 Aygul's ... 

727
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,740
 ... if your hair is damaged ... 

728
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,080
 ... I burn all Kulucahisar. 

729
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,600
 Yakarım! 

730
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,560
 [Leave me! Leave!] 

731
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,060
 Walk! 

732
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,580
 Andreas! 

733
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,940
 Leave the lady. 

734
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,420
 I Aygül. 

735
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:39,465
 My moon girl. 

736
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,740
 Are you okay? They didn't do you a mess, did they? 

737
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,680
 I'm fine, dad. 

738
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,980
 What does the heart seek to touch me in these genes? 

739
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,000
 If there was a heart in these ... 

740
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,120
 ... instead of slandering Osman ... 

741
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:00,645
 they would find the killer of their Tekfur. 

742
01:04:01,415 --> 01:04:03,195
 I trusted Osman. 

743
01:04:04,485 --> 01:04:06,115
 My husband was trusting too. 

744
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,580
 He gave him the privilege that he had never given to anyone. 

745
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,980
 My husband's murderer is Osman. 

746
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,080
 Aygul. 

747
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,020
 There are witnesses to it. 

748
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:22,855
 Osman! 

749
01:04:23,495 --> 01:04:25,465
 Osman without surrender ... 

750
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:29,625
 ... neither you nor your father or apricot men ... 

751
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,140
 ... cannot survive this castle! 

752
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,520
 Kalanoz! 

753
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,580
 Command, sir. 

754
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,000
 Until Osman came ... 

755
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,740
 ... put them all in the dungeon. 

756
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:46,915
 Byzantine ... 

757
01:04:47,305 --> 01:04:49,335
 ... you showed your ugly face, Sofia. 

758
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:51,235
 You showed. 

759
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,075
 Osman made excuses and ... 

760
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,320
 ... you try to break the agreement we made with Tekfur? 

761
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,520
 Osman is not in this castle! 

762
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,460
 We all know that. 

763
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:02,665
 I realized that... 

764
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,980
 ... your intention is not Osman ... 

765
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,680
 ...it was me. 

766
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
 Our... 

767
01:05:11,605 --> 01:05:13,355
 ... if our hair is damaged ... 

768
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:15,875
 ... all Turkish oba ... 

769
01:05:16,555 --> 01:05:18,945
 ... will collapse on you like a nightmare. 

770
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:20,185
 You know. 

771
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:25,135
 Just like you for a single hair of your daughter ... 

772
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:27,415
 ... if you burn all Kulucahisar ... 

773
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,640
 ... in Tekfur a drop of blood ... 

774
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,620
 ... I drown all the Turkish oba. 

775
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,860
 Take them! 

776
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,920
 Get them! 

777
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,200
 All of it! 

778
01:06:02,985 --> 01:06:03,985
 Osman. 

779
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,295
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

780
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:42,275
 Whether healing. 

781
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,240
 Make my lord victorious against the enemy. 

782
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,320
 Amine. 

783
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,440
 To all the girls in Oba ... 

784
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,080
 ... you will inform all the alps. 

785
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,980
 Cenk drum run. 

786
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,020
 They'll be ready! We can act at any moment. 

787
01:07:03,355 --> 01:07:04,725
 Zühre Hatun. 

788
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:07,095
 Are we going to act? 

789
01:07:09,475 --> 01:07:11,345
 We are a Turkish chick. 

790
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,500
 Our profession, called cenk, is a profession. 

791
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,880
 You were roaring. 

792
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:27,105
 Let's talk now, Mr. Dundar. 

793
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:30,515
 You wouldn't believe Osman was in the castle. 

794
01:07:30,795 --> 01:07:32,005
 Look here. 

795
01:07:32,525 --> 01:07:35,095
 In front of us as soldiers. 

796
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:39,465
 I got what I wanted. 

797
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,740
 I managed to bring Osman to my feet. 

798
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,400
 Sofia is the one who comes to your feet. 

799
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,900
 Drop them! Otherwise, everyone will die. 

800
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,820
 My husband's ... 

801
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,640
 ... you killed all my soldiers. 

802
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,200
 Drop Andreas! 

803
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:05,035
 Didn't you get enough of your blood, Osman? 

804
01:08:06,005 --> 01:08:08,255
 I keep my promise. 

805
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,715
 Without taking my nephew Osman ... 

806
01:08:12,385 --> 01:08:13,695
 ...I am not going anywhere. 

807
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,520
 Get the news. 

808
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,260
 Be comfortable for Mr. Dundar. 

809
01:08:19,145 --> 01:08:22,535
 Osman is also among your women ... 

810
01:08:23,045 --> 01:08:25,655
 ... will be tried in a fair court. 

811
01:08:26,245 --> 01:08:28,935
 Kayı gentlemen will also be in this court. 

812
01:08:29,825 --> 01:08:31,985
 We are not shedding blood ... 

813
01:08:32,695 --> 01:08:34,935
 ... we are after the truth. 

814
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,125
 Sofia ... 

815
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,440
 ... is right, Dundar Bey. 

816
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,720
 We also ... 

817
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,240
 ... We incident ... 

818
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:03,735
 ... we did the same. 

819
01:09:05,515 --> 01:09:06,515
 Mr. Bamsı! 

820
01:09:08,615 --> 01:09:11,315
 Do you hear your ear coming out of your mouth? 

821
01:09:12,425 --> 01:09:14,435
 Where will we go without Osman? 

822
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:28,775
 My heart is blood. 

823
01:09:31,885 --> 01:09:33,675
 For the good of all of us ... 

824
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:36,355
 ... a fair court should be established. 

825
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:00,485
 Soldiers! 

826
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:02,655
 Lower the spears. 

827
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:20,935
 Osman. 

828
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,595
 Emmi. 

829
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:28,995
 Go. 

830
01:10:32,245 --> 01:10:33,995
 Bamsı Bey tells the truth. 

831
01:10:48,155 --> 01:10:51,115
 Soldiers! Give the guns of Dundar Bey. 

832
01:10:51,605 --> 01:10:54,585
 Accompany you until you leave the castle. 

833
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,000
 Take Osman to the dungeon. 

834
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,700
 Osman is caught! He was the castle. Hurry up! 

835
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,185
 Hurry, hurry up. 

836
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:41,865
 It's almost done. 

837
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,440
 Let your eyes open. 

838
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,820
 Osman Bey, you couldn't protect your blood brother! 

839
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,140
 How do you let it die? 

840
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,360
 How do you let it? 

841
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,960
 Answer my questions. I don't care if you saved my life, I'll take your head. 

842
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,100
 Did you kill Tekfur? 

843
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,815
 What Tekfur? What to kill? 

844
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:06,955
 Did you kill Tekfur? 

845
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,800
 Shouldn't I ask you this question? 

846
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,520
 While I was saving George Polos' life ... 

847
01:13:19,925 --> 01:13:22,665
 ... as a clumsy castle commander ... 

848
01:13:23,855 --> 01:13:25,285
 ... you were wandering around. 

849
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:30,765
 The assassination attempt was also a game, right? 

850
01:13:33,005 --> 01:13:36,035
 You Turks were behind this. 

851
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:38,155
 Tell me now ... 

852
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,980
 ... dressed as soldiers ... 

853
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,320
 What were you doing in Tekfur's room? 

854
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:47,760
 I entered the castle to search for those who wanted to kill my absorption with Tekfur. 

855
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,240
 But I'm late. 

856
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,340
 Both ... 

857
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,200
 Why should I kill Tekfur? 

858
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:58,625
 He accepted the deal. 

859
01:14:00,495 --> 01:14:03,755
 You were the only one who didn't accept the deal! 

860
01:14:06,995 --> 01:14:08,825
 If a suspect is to be sought ... 

861
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,560
 ... it's you too, Kalanoz. 

862
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,760
 Why did you kill our Tekfur? 

863
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,180
 While betrayal and fitna are spreading from the castle where you are the commander ... 

864
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:19,085
 ... would you blame me? 

865
01:14:19,695 --> 01:14:22,525
 As you escape from the room where you killed Tekfur and threw it down ... 

866
01:14:22,655 --> 01:14:24,125
 my soldiers saw you. 

867
01:14:26,005 --> 01:14:28,015
 You're wrong, Kalanoz. 

868
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:30,365
 Poor Tekfur fell before me. 

869
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,985
 When I looked up, I saw two shadows. 

870
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,540
 Shadows huh? 

871
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,340
 It meant they were more than one. 

872
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,520
 Yeah. 

873
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:48,820
 Tekfur caught by surprise. 

874
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,220
 Since they can enter this much ... 

875
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,700
 ... there must be someone he knows. 

876
01:14:56,645 --> 01:14:58,005
 How do you know? 

877
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,315
 Because he was strangled. 

878
01:15:03,055 --> 01:15:05,275
 I've heard enough bullshit! 

879
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:14,175
 You know what I said right. 

880
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:19,275
 I'm not the killer. 

881
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,520
 Anyway, everything in court ... 

882
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,220
 ... will be exposed. 

883
01:15:26,545 --> 01:15:28,585
 And I am with great pleasure ... 

884
01:15:29,015 --> 01:15:31,065
 ... I'll tear your head off the torso. 

885
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,380
 Mr. Osman. 

886
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,855
 I don't know what decision comes from the court. 

887
01:16:00,655 --> 01:16:01,655
 Not that... 

888
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,855
 be sure ... 

889
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,245
 I'll find the murderers. 

890
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:14,385
 The deads... 

891
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,620
 ... can't find anything. 

892
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,360
 Osman. 

893
01:16:27,185 --> 01:16:29,855
 Lock the door and don't let anyone in! 

894
01:17:17,385 --> 01:17:19,075
 You called me, sir. 

895
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,380
 You thought very well. 

896
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,860
 Osman will only speak like this. 

897
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,840
 Let's peel your nails and teeth. 

898
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,900
 May you feel the pain until it is soaking. 

899
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,280
 I don't think we can make Osman to be tortured. 

900
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,180
 This has no choice, sir. 

901
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:40,940
 There is. 

902
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,360
 If Osman managed to get the holy trust, 

903
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,660
 ... cooperates with our greatest enemies. 

904
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,800
 Someone would never surrender to pain, Helen. 

905
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,900
 If Osman goes to court, Tekfur's death becomes suspicious. 

906
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:00,920
 ...Sir. 

907
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,960
 We cannot allow this. 

908
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,920
 Osman will not go to court, Helen. 

909
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:07,245
 He will escape from the dungeon. 

910
01:18:08,805 --> 01:18:11,315
 Are we going to kidnap him from the dungeon? 

911
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,155
 No, he will run away. 

912
01:18:15,675 --> 01:18:18,995
 Not to surrender without taking his precaution ... 

913
01:18:19,105 --> 01:18:20,855
 Osman is smart. 

914
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:26,555
 Moreover, he is not alone in the castle. 

915
01:18:27,065 --> 01:18:30,015
 It is not possible to take the treasure alone. 

916
01:18:31,025 --> 01:18:33,965
 Do you think the Alps have leaked to the castle? 

917
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:37,865
 Catch it all at once. 

918
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:42,760
 The smartest thing we can do to get the holy trust ... 

919
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,540
 ... will be letting him escape from the dungeon. 

920
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:48,995
 Now... 

921
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,440
 ... call my most trusted hunter Teokles. 

922
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,560
 Order him and his men. 

923
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,060
 This is very dangerous, sir. 

924
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:02,400
 If Osman Teokles gets rid of it, we will never be able to reach the holy trust. 

925
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,640
 Rather than the wrath of Master Yannis ... 

926
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,720
 We're going to play this dangerous game, Helen. 

927
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,915
 Do what I say right now! 

928
01:19:12,505 --> 01:19:14,075
 Go call Teokles! 

929
01:19:37,045 --> 01:19:39,105
 Put the barrels next to the others. 

930
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,985
 The last meal of Tekfur's killer will be pork soup. 

931
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,580
 Here I am very laughed at. 

932
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,300
 Bring the soup bowl. 

933
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,660
 A little more. 

934
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,900
 Put the meat a little more. 

935
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,540
 Before you conceive, you will be well. 

936
01:20:15,505 --> 01:20:16,875
 What are you looking at? 

937
01:20:18,155 --> 01:20:20,855
 Isn't he a Muslim? He doesn't drink that soup. 

938
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,575
 The fun is also there. 

939
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,180
 What are you involved in? 

940
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,020
 There is no escape from hell for him. 

941
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,400
 Where else can a Turk go? 

942
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,275
 Come on, you too. 

943
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,780
 Exit. 

944
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,180
 Teokles. 

945
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:47,895
 You called me Helen. 

946
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,975
 Princess Sofia ... 

947
01:21:58,975 --> 01:22:02,305
 I remember the day he carved one eye with his finger. 

948
01:22:06,325 --> 01:22:09,045
 If you want to save your second eye ... 

949
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:13,355
 ... listen well to what I say Teokles. 

950
01:22:29,955 --> 01:22:31,055
 In mind ... 

951
01:22:31,515 --> 01:22:34,075
 ... a horse without the honor of beech ... 

952
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:37,065
 ... what's börg at the beginning? 

953
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,840
 For honor, pusat unused for ar ... 

954
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,760
 ... what is it for? 

955
01:23:03,095 --> 01:23:04,895
 These are not necessary for you. 

956
01:23:15,745 --> 01:23:16,995
 To you... 

957
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:20,065
 ... the fiancee of our martyr Aybars ... 

958
01:23:20,685 --> 01:23:21,695
 ...and... 

959
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:24,455
 ... we entrusted my sister Aygül. 

960
01:23:26,195 --> 01:23:27,835
 What did you do? 

961
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,480
 What did you do? 

962
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:32,480
 Tell me! 

963
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,720
 You could not claim safety. 

964
01:23:44,755 --> 01:23:47,035
 Even my soul did not hear when my sister was kidnapped. 

965
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:54,060
 Kayi alpine means the erected hawk on watch. 

966
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,600
 It means a warrior who takes death for his honor. 

967
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,040
 Who can't take care of safety ... 

968
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,080
 ... who cannot keep his honor ... 

969
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,700
 neither deserves to be foolish, nor pusat! 

970
01:24:09,575 --> 01:24:10,735
 Not that... 

971
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,140
 ... I will give you your right. 

972
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,420
 You never worry. 

973
01:24:22,915 --> 01:24:24,305
 Well, Dundar Bey. 

974
01:24:24,735 --> 01:24:27,875
 You gave your life, you wouldn't give Osman to them. 

975
01:24:27,935 --> 01:24:29,335
 Why did you quit? 

976
01:24:29,655 --> 01:24:32,005
 Eagles don't fit in the cage, chick. 

977
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,400
 It does not fit. 

978
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:39,980
 Ea ... 

979
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,120
 ... tell me Bamsı. 

980
01:24:42,855 --> 01:24:44,455
 Thank you Dündar Bey. 

981
01:24:46,605 --> 01:24:49,825
 Zühre Hatun was to be my Osman. 

982
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:52,365
 We weren't here. 

983
01:25:20,505 --> 01:25:23,925
 I did not speak on the spot because he was playing a game. 

984
01:25:29,815 --> 01:25:30,935
 Not that... 

985
01:25:31,575 --> 01:25:34,105
 ... I will take precautions despite everything. 

986
01:25:34,105 --> 01:25:35,105
 Mr. Bamsı! 

987
01:25:35,495 --> 01:25:38,975
 Will we be grateful to Osman after all those galleries? 

988
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,800
 Not only your own life, but your ... 

989
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:46,280
 ... endangered the lives of my father, Samsa Bey, my sister, everyone. 

990
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,440
 How much longer does this go? 

991
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,260
 What if he is found guilty in court? 

992
01:25:52,835 --> 01:25:54,635
 What if he really killed Tekfur? 

993
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:58,635
 I don't know it. 

994
01:26:01,225 --> 01:26:04,045
 I would like to ask Osman about all this. 

995
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:05,115
 For... 

996
01:26:05,355 --> 01:26:07,845
 ... if the murder falls on Osman ... 

997
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:10,560
 ... the Sultan of Seljuk asks us to account for all this. 

998
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,460
 Enough brother! 

999
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,220
 Enough! 

1000
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:14,720
 You couldn't fit Osman in the big oba. 

1001
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,000
 My sister, you say ... 

1002
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,520
 ... my dad say 

1003
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,260
 ... Osman sacrificed himself for your father for what you said! 

1004
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,000
 Aygul! 

1005
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:22,840
 Batur! 

1006
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,980
 Batur is right. 

1007
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:57,045
 If Osman is found guilty in court ... 

1008
01:26:59,285 --> 01:27:02,395
 ... Byzantium does not chase this business. 

1009
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,200
 What would he do if he did not let Dündar? 

1010
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,860
 When were we afraid of Byzantium and now let's be afraid? 

1011
01:27:09,195 --> 01:27:12,315
 It's not a matter of Byzantium, Bamsı Bey. 

1012
01:27:13,565 --> 01:27:15,655
 If Byzantine got into this business ... 

1013
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:18,455
 ... the Mongols will enter. 

1014
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,660
 Erewhile... 

1015
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,180
 my father should turn to oba. 

1016
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,760
 God willing... 

1017
01:27:27,505 --> 01:27:29,665
 ... he also signs with the sultan in Konya ... 

1018
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,680
 ... this issue is solved. 

1019
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:32,800
 God willing. 

1020
01:29:33,145 --> 01:29:35,495
 What happened? Don't you like it? 

1021
01:29:35,535 --> 01:29:38,085
 These are the last meals Osman Bey. 

1022
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:40,735
 Enjoy it. The pig in it ... 

1023
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,940
 ... will carry you to heaven on your back. 

1024
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:22,980
 Genetic dog! 

1025
01:32:28,255 --> 01:32:30,305
 Who last entered the dungeon? 

1026
01:32:30,835 --> 01:32:32,885
 Who entered this dungeon last? 

1027
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,280
 Helen. 

1028
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,400
 Helen. 

1029
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,920
 Helen. 

1030
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,280
 Helen. 

1031
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,100
 Close the doors! Catch Osman! 

1032
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,140
 This castle will not come alive! 

1033
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:54,340
 Sofia ... 

1034
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,560
 Black earth. 

1035
01:33:27,545 --> 01:33:28,545
 Say it to me. 

1036
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,060
 Call me black earth. 

1037
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,980
 Is the brave in your chest comfortable? 

1038
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:38,695
 His father ... 

1039
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,600
 ... is it from Iraq? 

1040
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,960
 Kadir Mawla ... 

1041
01:33:54,435 --> 01:33:57,455
 ... he shouldn't need it. 

1042
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,860
 Your mother with white hair .. 

1043
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,280
 ...Rest in peace. 

1044
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,100
 My God... 

1045
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,040
 ... the bee should not separate it from faith. 

1046
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,220
 Those who say amen ... 

1047
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,100
 ... your dear face. 

1048
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,340
 May the hope of Allah be stopped. 

1049
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,860
 my sins ... 

1050
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:31,400
 ... the name of the beautiful Muhammad face water ... 

1051
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,700
 ... forgive. 

1052
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,960
 I aybars. 

1053
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,520
 You never worry, Aybars. 

1054
01:35:07,565 --> 01:35:08,565
 I Uthman ... 

1055
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,000
 ... won't put your blood on the floor. 

1056
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,040
 I Uthman ... 

1057
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:19,520
 will take your revenge. 

1058
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,740
 If the king you made was a king, the brothers would not make a wolf. 

1059
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,840
 Now... 

1060
01:36:07,655 --> 01:36:10,385
 ... we are one step closer to the truth brothers. 

1061
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,100
 The whole knot will be unraveled in the nun. 

1062
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:13,880
 Thank you. 

1063
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:14,880
 Thank you sir. 

1064
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,100
 Hopefully, sir. 

1065
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,980
 Protect Osman Bey! 

1066
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,260
 Konuralp! 

1067
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,040
 Hello, sir. 

1068
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:56,700
 And hey hello. 

1069
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,620
 And hey hello. 

1070
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,360
 And hey hello. 

1071
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,215
 I learned you were in the castle, I would come to see you. 

1072
01:37:11,215 --> 01:37:13,155
 I know your contest, Konuralp. 

1073
01:37:14,175 --> 01:37:15,915
 If I say ahead of us ... 

1074
01:37:16,405 --> 01:37:17,795
 ... come out. 

1075
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,440
 Come to our table. 

1076
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:23,000
 With my head, sir. 

1077
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,460
 Did you handle the task? 

1078
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:36,080
 Oops, sir. 

1079
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,440
 Special structures of all castles in Bitinya were removed one by one, sir. 

1080
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,120
 O miserable. 

1081
01:37:53,375 --> 01:37:55,565
 Distances between the walls ... 

1082
01:37:55,575 --> 01:37:57,185
 ... the number of soldiers guarding ... 

1083
01:37:57,725 --> 01:37:59,255
 ... the height of the walls ... 

1084
01:37:59,725 --> 01:38:00,975
 ... we have it all. 

1085
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,720
 Even Nikea and Pursa. 

1086
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,740
 I'm proud of you, Konuralp. 

1087
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,200
 Thank you sir. 

1088
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:11,945
 We will open the doors to the gas again. 

1089
01:38:12,045 --> 01:38:14,005
 And the lands we conquered ... 

1090
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:17,120
 ... we will name the valiant conquers. 

1091
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,420
 Hopefully, sir. 

1092
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,100
 Biznillah ... 

1093
01:38:20,545 --> 01:38:22,375
 ... the places we print are dorm ... 

1094
01:38:23,085 --> 01:38:24,085
 ... those places ... 

1095
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,420
 ... who took refuge in the oppressed ... 

1096
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:28,840
 will be a long-established state. 

1097
01:38:32,725 --> 01:38:33,725
 Not that... 

1098
01:38:34,615 --> 01:38:37,455
 ... we will avenge my brother Aybars first. 

1099
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:38,725
 Non... 

1100
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,280
 ... we see the sahmeran ... 

1101
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,220
 ... it doesn't matter if it is a seven-headed dragon. 

1102
01:38:47,105 --> 01:38:50,175
 Be quiet, Osman must be here. 

1103
01:39:05,225 --> 01:39:06,425
 We found your traces. 

1104
01:39:07,685 --> 01:39:10,175
 I don't even want a crunch, be careful. 

1105
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,360
 Healing, my father. 

1106
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,560
 Thank you, girl. 

1107
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,260
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1108
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:55,480
 Before cluttering, it is necessary to find Osman and set up the court. 

1109
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:59,280
 Or because Tekfur is a murderer ... 

1110
01:39:59,285 --> 01:40:01,585
 ... they raise Byzantine to their feet ... 

1111
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:02,960
 ... the Seljuk. 

1112
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,060
 Let's see what trouble will open up to us? 

1113
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:11,985
 Is there any destim, sir? 

1114
01:40:13,285 --> 01:40:14,475
 You're coming. 

1115
01:40:19,385 --> 01:40:21,755
 Osman Bey, who is out of the safe fortress. 

1116
01:40:22,015 --> 01:40:24,245
 An alpine came to the oba and reported it. 

1117
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,420
 Where is Osman's alpine now? 

1118
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:32,720
 Sir, he gave the news. 

1119
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:42,800
 If Batur is near Osman's alpine, you should follow him. 

1120
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,600
 Osman almost ... 

1121
01:40:44,915 --> 01:40:45,915
 ... find you. 

1122
01:41:15,415 --> 01:41:17,535
 Turkish-friendly Yorgo Polos ... 

1123
01:41:17,705 --> 01:41:20,125
 ... it was a shame for us. 

1124
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:34,440
 Kulucahisar is now a true Christian fortress. 

1125
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:43,480
 They should be nearby, we will ambush him. 

1126
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,060
 Hayy is Allah! 

1127
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,920
 God is right! 

1128
01:42:25,735 --> 01:42:27,435
 Where the jackal will fall ... 

1129
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,300
 ... is the wolf's paw. 

1130
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,720
 Who dropped you on my head? 

1131
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,180
 Say, well. 

1132
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:32,820
 Talk! 

1133
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:40,920
 No! No! 

1134
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,100
 No! No I have no eyes! 

1135
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,660
 I can't stop! 

1136
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,860
 Stop no I have no eyes! 

1137
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,000
 I have no eyes! 

1138
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:47,580
 Talk. 

1139
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:48,180
 I can't stop! 

1140
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,960
 Let me forgive both your eyes and your eyes. 

1141
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,720
 Stop, stop, stop! Stop! 

1142
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:54,840
 Okay! Ok i will say 

1143
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:57,100
 I will say! I will say! I will say! 

1144
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,760
 I'll tell you okay! 

1145
01:43:59,535 --> 01:44:00,535
 Sofia! 

1146
01:44:00,915 --> 01:44:01,965
 Sofia! 

1147
01:44:02,745 --> 01:44:04,225
 Princess Sofia! 

1148
01:44:15,995 --> 01:44:17,005
 This it ... 

1149
01:44:17,465 --> 01:44:19,235
 ... we'll keep a time. 

1150
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:20,820
 Storm! 

1151
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:24,040
 You keep it in secret beech. 

1152
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:29,215
 My command, my head, sir. 

1153
01:44:36,595 --> 01:44:37,595
 Bey. 

1154
01:44:38,225 --> 01:44:40,205
 Why did Sofia pursue you? 

1155
01:44:41,405 --> 01:44:44,025
 Konuralp knows that I did not kill her husband. 

1156
01:44:45,565 --> 01:44:46,995
 It's not me. 

1157
01:44:48,075 --> 01:44:50,245
 Sisters who saved me in the swamp. 

1158
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,500
 I don't even know the nuns, sir. 

1159
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:54,200
 You said it now. 

1160
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:56,720
 What the nuns do with him ... 

1161
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:58,940
 ... he thinks he has something to do with me. 

1162
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:01,780
 That's why he's been pushing his knuckles since the dungeon. 

1163
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,260
 If we find the nuns ... 

1164
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,220
 ... we will find answers to many questions. 

1165
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,200
 When we say they cannot find our mark ... 

1166
01:46:10,825 --> 01:46:13,000
 ... they have entered our heart. 

1167
01:46:13,765 --> 01:46:14,765
 Sir. 

1168
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:17,480
 How did they find the treasure? 

1169
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,940
 We will learn this from Osman. 

1170
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,700
 Bring it to me! 

1171
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,005
 Master Yannis. 

1172
01:46:26,845 --> 01:46:29,495
 To reach the relics of Sofia ... 

1173
01:46:30,445 --> 01:46:33,005
 ... allowed Osman to escape from the dungeon. 

1174
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,200
 Who did Osman go after? 

1175
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,420
 Hunter Teokles, sir. 

1176
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,900
 The most important teacher in life ... 

1177
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,760
 ... are the pain. 

1178
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,480
 Now... 

1179
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,380
 ...tell me. 

1180
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,460
 Playing ... 

1181
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,460
 ...treasure... 

1182
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,340
 ...where? 

1183
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,960
 Where is Sofia? 

1184
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,940
 You are aware that you have come, sir. 

1185
01:47:54,535 --> 01:47:55,895
 It's about to come. 

1186
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,240
 How do we explain this to master Yannis? 

1187
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:17,400
 I do not know! 

1188
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,860
 However, master Yannis will be very angry with it. 

1189
01:48:29,075 --> 01:48:30,325
 Where are you going Sofia? 

1190
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,580
 It is time to learn what you are up to. 

1191
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,520
 Mr. Osman! 

1192
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:09,840
 Deh! 

1193
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,820
 Alps! 

1194
01:49:30,715 --> 01:49:32,555
 You shoot arrows in front of me. 

1195
01:49:33,505 --> 01:49:35,565
 You will meet me without a hat. 

1196
01:49:36,215 --> 01:49:38,515
 Are you friends? Are you an enemy? 

1197
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,940
 Who are you? 

1198
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:41,280
 Cruel alp ... 

1199
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,620
 ... we have the oppressed, son. 

1200
01:49:44,065 --> 01:49:47,025
 We have to do it by taking you to what he calls. 

1201
01:50:08,025 --> 01:50:09,895
 Now you are dressed as a Turk. 

1202
01:50:12,015 --> 01:50:13,625
 Yaman valiant, Osman Bey. 

1203
01:50:13,625 --> 01:50:16,125
 You came here after your curiosity. 

1204
01:50:16,135 --> 01:50:17,295
 Not to worry! 

1205
01:50:17,815 --> 01:50:19,185
 Following my revenge. 

1206
01:50:20,595 --> 01:50:21,595
 Say, well. 

1207
01:50:22,605 --> 01:50:25,935
 Who are you? Why are you secrets yourself? 

1208
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:27,780
 Come with me if you want to learn this. 

1209
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,040
 Here I am! 

1210
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:32,160
 Tell me whatever your secret is now. 

1211
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:34,120
 The answers of the questions are not mine. 

1212
01:50:34,915 --> 01:50:37,375
 If you want to be a foundation, dream of me. 

1213
01:50:39,615 --> 01:50:42,035
 If it is not the truth you wish, there is a way to go. 

1214
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,880
 However, we must go alone where we are going. 

1215
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,960
 Say it to the Alps. 

1216
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,720
 Let them wait here with dervish. 

1217
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:57,960
 Alps! 

1218
01:50:59,035 --> 01:51:00,065
 Wait here. 

1219
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,080
 Master Yannis. 

1220
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,060
 I couldn't protect the secret, sir. 

1221
01:52:32,385 --> 01:52:35,535
 Get the honor of paying the price. 

1222
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:29,920
 They have infiltrated ourselves in Serez, Sofia. 

1223
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:33,240
 There is a spy in the Margarit Monastery. 

1224
01:53:33,905 --> 01:53:36,245
 We will find out who he is. 

1225
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,100
 How does this happen? 

1226
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:41,340
 I came here to take back the sacred trust of the Turks. 

1227
01:53:42,695 --> 01:53:44,835
 Not to take your life. 

1228
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:47,880
 Sofia! 

1229
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:53,320
 What's going on here? 

1230
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,340
 What are you doing here, Andreas? 

1231
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:05,020
 You are my most loyal lover. 

1232
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:07,260
 What the hell are you doing here? 

1233
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,780
 What's going on here, Sofia? 

1234
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:11,780
 Kalanoz. 

1235
01:54:11,975 --> 01:54:13,945
 First put your sword in your sheath. 

1236
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,240
 I have something to tell you. 

1237
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,000
 Now! 

1238
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:20,495
 Now you will tell me what's going on here, Sofia! 

1239
01:54:20,495 --> 01:54:21,895
 Right now! 

1240
01:54:22,995 --> 01:54:23,995
 Soldiers! 

1241
01:54:24,415 --> 01:54:26,775
 Arrest Sofia and those next to it. 

1242
01:54:28,845 --> 01:54:30,825
 Drop your sword now, Commander Kalanoz! 

1243
01:54:34,005 --> 01:54:36,095
 Drop your sword now! 

1244
01:55:14,565 --> 01:55:16,335
 Welcome, Nizamettin Efendi. 

1245
01:55:25,485 --> 01:55:28,115
 You haven't paid bac for a good time, Hasan Efendi. 

1246
01:55:29,105 --> 01:55:32,045
 Let's see, do you deserve this loom? 

1247
01:55:34,635 --> 01:55:37,005
 You see that huge market place? 

1248
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,620
 If I don't get the chunks on time ... 

1249
01:55:39,785 --> 01:55:41,640
 How do I get my order here? 

1250
01:55:41,745 --> 01:55:43,325
 No need to explain. 

1251
01:55:48,045 --> 01:55:51,415
 Until tomorrow, if you do not pay your leg, you will disband your counter. 

1252
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:08,940
 This is Osman. 

1253
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:33,260
 Nizamettin Bey. 

1254
01:57:59,425 --> 01:58:01,405
 You said truth, Osman Bey. 

1255
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:04,125
 Here Basin. 

1256
01:58:49,635 --> 01:58:51,745
 Now you're on the brink of truth. 

1257
01:58:53,495 --> 01:58:57,065
 Meet our informal companion and find answers to your questions. 

1258
01:58:57,335 --> 01:58:58,895
 Who is your companion? 

1259
01:58:59,545 --> 01:59:01,255
 Open the doors of your secret. 

1260
01:59:01,605 --> 01:59:03,425
 You can see with your own eyes. 

1261
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:49,555
 Who do I meet? I would like to know. 

1262
02:00:14,215 --> 02:00:16,685
 We're a strange right passenger, kid. 

1263
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:24,120
 Our name is blown as faith in our ear. 

1264
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:28,120
 Population ... 

1265
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:30,895
 ... knows Edabali. 

1266
02:00:32,235 --> 02:00:33,235
 The Edabal. 

1267
02:00:39,775 --> 02:00:41,275
 My father's companion. 

1268
02:00:43,995 --> 02:00:46,155
 The light of Oğuz is Edabali. 

1269
02:00:53,035 --> 02:00:55,875
 It has never been possible to see your face until today. 

1270
02:00:58,275 --> 02:00:59,745
 Thank goodness to my Lord. 

1271
02:01:14,095 --> 02:01:15,375
 My wolf post ... 

1272
02:01:17,025 --> 02:01:20,015
 ... gentleman does not bow in front of anyone, son. 

1273
02:01:46,825 --> 02:01:47,825
 Who is this? 

1274
02:01:48,345 --> 02:01:51,275
 The head of the chimneys is my daughter, Bala Hatun. 

1275
02:01:53,355 --> 02:01:55,145
 As you can see ... 

1276
02:01:55,375 --> 02:01:57,615
 ... my daughter's companion is Gonca. 

1277
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:02,720
 Pastor master is also Tursun, one of our lovers. 

1278
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,080
 There are many things that are not what they seem, son. 

1279
02:02:11,905 --> 02:02:13,405
 The black you call ak ... 

1280
02:02:14,545 --> 02:02:16,495
 ... what you call black becomes white ... 

1281
02:02:17,015 --> 02:02:18,745
 ... wisdom exceeds reason. 

1282
02:02:19,495 --> 02:02:21,855
 Wisdom is the job of great people like you. 

1283
02:02:23,325 --> 02:02:25,625
 I look for the murderers of my brother Aybars. 

1284
02:02:28,215 --> 02:02:29,595
 I picked it up from my father. 

1285
02:02:30,115 --> 02:02:31,685
 I know you from Kırşehir. 

1286
02:02:32,995 --> 02:02:34,695
 What are you doing here? 

1287
02:02:35,145 --> 02:02:36,505
 Why did you come? 

1288
02:02:37,105 --> 02:02:38,515
 We came here. 

1289
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:42,405
 To blow the Yesevi breath. 

1290
02:02:44,765 --> 02:02:46,675
 Burn the resurrection paper clip ... 

1291
02:02:47,395 --> 02:02:49,205
 ... to burn our stove ... 

1292
02:02:49,945 --> 02:02:52,185
 ... to build a new world. 

1293
02:02:55,425 --> 02:02:56,665
 On this happy road ... 

1294
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,240
 ... do you have to be comrades with us? 

1295
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,160
 I am alhamdulillah. 

1296
02:03:12,945 --> 02:03:13,945
 Not that... 

1297
02:03:14,585 --> 02:03:15,715
 ...I have a condition. 

1298
02:03:18,645 --> 02:03:21,085
 I would like to have all the secrets. 

1299
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:24,400
 At that time... 

1300
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,660
 ... you should listen to me well.

1
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,020
 Soldiers ... 

2
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,860
 Arrest Osman. 

3
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,500
 Mr. Alişar! 

4
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 What is taking the son of a gentleman out of his bed? 

5
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,180
 He has a starboard lord. 

6
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
 Sheathe that dagger. 

7
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,020
 Download your swords. 

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,880
 I wash this quarry with the blood of soldiers Alişar Bey 

9
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,900
 Stay away from my brother. 

10
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,600
 Stay back, Day. 

11
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
 Don't let my mind touch you either. 

12
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
 That the calonose is dead ... 

13
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,340
 Where did you hear Alişar Bey? 

14
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,720
 I was in the castle. 

15
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,220
 They said the Kalosn was the Kayi who killed. 

16
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,780
 What do Dundar Bey speak when you are there? 

17
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,340
 We... 

18
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
 We are the Kayi soldiers Alişar Bey 

19
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
 Will other than Allah ... 

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,220
 Apart from his apostle, we do not know the authority. 

21
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,540
 Mr. Dundar. 

22
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,640
 Think well. 

23
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,220
 The end of this job or mass execution ... 

24
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,040
 Or it is exile. 

25
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,280
 Wouldn't Mongolian I was affiliated in Konya ask for this? 

26
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,420
 Osman is not guilty, do you know? 

27
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,860
 You will increase us because of Kulucahisar. 

28
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,800
 Neither they nor you ... 

29
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,720
 My concern is justice. 

30
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,380
 If you're Sancak Bey ... 

31
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,960
 If you stood in our head that it would stand in the middle then. 

32
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,800
 If you weren't so unsatisfied. 

33
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,700
 Enough Osman! 

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,260
 I am not going to learn the destruct or order from you. 

35
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,040
 Now I get your head. 

36
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,180
 What do you think you're doing here are heedless? 

37
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,000
 Osman killed Kalanoz 

38
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,880
 He'll give you his account now. 

39
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,300
 Do not you know that we will not give Osman Bey to you? 

40
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,740
 Will you prevent me? 

41
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,640
 Get out! 

42
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 Pulling pusat and stepping on Bey's bed ... 

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,300
 We don't step on the floor, Apturrahman Gazi .. 

44
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,500
 We do our duty. 

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,440
 If you are not guilty, why would you stand behind the pusat? 

46
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
 Are you afraid of my laughter? 

47
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 Evelallah ... 

48
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,620
 I am not afraid of anything that I can see. 

49
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,060
 But I'm afraid of chastity Alişar Bey 

50
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,460
 Do you think I will sacrifice you to the wife of the shroud? 

51
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,860
 I'm going to set up a fair court. 

52
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
 Osman... 

53
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,380
 This work has Byzantium. 

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,260
 He has Mongolian ... 

55
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,880
 I don't want new trouble. 

56
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
 Take your mind. 

57
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,360
 I do not hesitate about the judgment you will make either from the court. 

58
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,940
 But 

59
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,380
 I would like to talk to Sophia face to face. 

60
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
 Osman don't trust this man. 

61
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,300
 Osman you don't have to go, my nephew. 

62
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,580
 The last pusat of beech ... 

63
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
 Until the last drop of our blood ... 

64
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,360
 We will defend you. 

65
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,660
 I am both pusat ... 

66
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,720
 Alişar Bey is your duty to your justice 

67
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
 Alişar Bey 

68
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
 Last night, the New Market was raided ... 

69
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
 Our men were murdered. 

70
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 Who would do that, 

71
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
 I will arrive at the New Market. 

72
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,980
 Take this to the mansion and wait in the dungeon until I come. 

73
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,300
 Mr. Osman 

74
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
 Is it afraid of death ... 

75
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,500
 Waiting for death? 

76
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 In the first chant you gave ... 

77
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 I don't know, I'm Sheikh. 

78
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,220
 The sultan of the heroes ... 

79
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,820
 Hz. Hamza... 

80
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 The end of your life is right ... 

81
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
 To the wars he participated in ... 

82
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
 He was starting to go without armor ... 

83
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,540
 This is ... 

84
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
 He did not escape from the eye of Basab. 

85
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,740
 A few asked ... 

86
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,580
 O pusat the pus of the people ... 

87
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,820
 Joyful... 

88
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,640
 Didn't you read the verse of Allah, do not endanger yourself? 

89
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
 Hz. Hamza... 

90
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,760
 He answered with fortitude ... 

91
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,040
 When I was young ... 

92
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,300
 I would see death as a farewell to this world ... 

93
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
 When my nephew ... 

94
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,480
 Hz. I was enlightened by the spirit of Muhammad ... 

95
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
 I realized. 

96
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,400
 Death... 

97
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
 Whose eyes look dangerous ... 

98
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,700
 Do not endanger yourself verse ... 

99
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,040
 It was for him. 

100
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,900
 The extract ... 

101
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
 Death is not an end ... 

102
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,900
 About opening the door of truth ... 

103
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,600
 It is a beginning. 

104
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
 Did we know this like this ... 

105
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 Not afraid of death ... 

106
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
 We are waiting for death. 

107
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
 In the circuit we are in ... 

108
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
 For those who open the convention door ... 

109
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
 Not those who fear death ... 

110
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
 Death kills ... 

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Hazrat Hamza with a steak ... 

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
 There will be valiant. 

113
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,140
 How happy they are ... 

114
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,760
 They do not worry about life or property. 

115
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,560
 Happily to those worlds that ... 

116
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,200
 Stunning the ... 

117
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
 They do not prefer their cases. 

118
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
 How happy for those heroes ... 

119
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
 Their names are for a generation ... 

120
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,080
 To an age ... 

121
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
 To a soul ... 

122
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,360
 It will be the name. 

123
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
 Who do you think you're playing with? 

124
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,060
 Did you think you could lie and get rid of my hand? 

125
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
 I deserved your wrath ... 

126
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 My only wish... 

127
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,140
 My last breath is to die as a Muslim. 

128
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,340
 My son ... 

129
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,340
 You martyred my Aybars. 

130
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,760
 You burned my lung and chopped my son. 

131
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,380
 My life is in your hands, Bamsı. 

132
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,740
 But if you don't hurt me ... 

133
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
 I'll adopt you in your remaining life. 

134
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
 I gave you a child pain, Bamsı Bey. 

135
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Do whatever it takes. 

136
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,400
 He killed the commander of Kulucahisar and ... 

137
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,680
 Throwing like an animal carcass means before us. 

138
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,580
 I will make you pay such a price ... 

139
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,180
 Osman will not remain without hearing. 

140
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,620
 At first Osman ... 

141
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,740
 Then all the apricots. 

142
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
 Later... 

143
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
 How many Turks ... 

144
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,040
 They take their hearts apart in order ... 

145
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 I will feed the dogs. 

146
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
 I swear. 

147
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,100
 How many soldiers we have lost ... 

148
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
 For each ... 

149
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,600
 Dozens of Turks ... 

150
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,960
 I'm gonna kill. 

151
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,040
 Alişar Bey must have taken Osman from his oba. 

152
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,820
 We can't touch the apricots before she gets pregnant. 

153
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,640
 Alişar Bey 

154
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
 Even if he takes Osman from apricots ... 

155
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,600
 It's hard to hold in your hand. 

156
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,380
 Osman get rid of ... 

157
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,960
 It will surely succeed. 

158
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,060
 Samsa Bey 

159
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,460
 Zorba, don't get our sister blood. 

160
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,700
 Salasın Osman Bey. 

161
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 We are servants of orders, Samsa Bey. 

162
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,460
 You can't put us in trouble. 

163
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,020
 Well, since ... 

164
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,540
 If anyone wants to close the book, put it on his sword. 

165
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,360
 I said once again, Zorba. 

166
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
 Come on then. 

167
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,480
 Siblings... 

168
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
 Lower your pusat. 

169
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
 Do not come to the rage of the Alps. 

170
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,940
 Do not pity yourself. 

171
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,540
 Bora brother, fastening the ropes of the stout. 

172
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,680
 They should not feed the bird in the wolf. 

173
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,340
 This is yours, sir. 

174
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
 Thank you Samsa sergeant. 

175
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,940
 I can't wait to watch Osman's death. 

176
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 You are right. 

177
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 But in case it gets rid of it. 

178
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
 We have to install our game now. 

179
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,460
 The messenger bird Nizamettin ... 

180
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,180
 It brought very valuable information. 

181
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,400
 Alişar Edebalı's daughter burned her brother. 

182
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,340
 Even this much ... 

183
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,700
 Enough to confront Alişar and Osman. 

184
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,400
 Don't forget alone ... 

185
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,960
 If Osman surrendered to Alişar ... 

186
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,560
 It definitely has a plan. 

187
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
 We have to act very carefully. 

188
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,940
 Still no news from Salavador? 

189
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,200
 No, sir. 

190
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,180
 Asla la ilaha illallah 

191
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,580
 Asla la ilaha illallah ... 

192
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,320
 and coeducine ... 

193
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,600
 and coeducine ... 

194
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,340
 Muhammad Abduhu and ... 

195
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,860
 Rasul. 

196
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,020
 Muhammad Abduhu and His Messenger. 

197
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
 What are we going to do now, Osman Bey? 

198
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,400
 Alişar Bey was coming from Konya in the Mongol invasion. 

199
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
 He would speak among the soldiers on his way. 

200
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
 In that case... 

201
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,080
 It's booty time, sir. 

202
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,740
 Osman Bey, who is troubled by the troubles of the Turk who comes to Alişar Bey, is a problem. 

203
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
 Turk's fortune ... 

204
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 It is not the butler who receive funds from the opponent ... 

205
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,180
 Your property, your life, ... 

206
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
 Who sacrificed for this cause ... 

207
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
 The coach will appoint valiant. 

208
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,340
 Samsa Sergeant ... 

209
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,980
 Tell Apturrahman Gazi ... 

210
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
 If you confiscate gold with the Alps. 

211
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,700
 Not that.. 

212
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
 For now, nobody knows what we do. 

213
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,840
 You don't worry, Osman Bey. 

214
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,900
 Is there any news from Bamsı? 

215
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,000
 Still not back, sir. 

216
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
 Let's catch up on the thesis without killing Salvador. 

217
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,840
 Sophia has the lock. 

218
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,860
 Our gaze be blessed. 

219
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
 Babes .. 

220
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
 What Alişar did ... 

221
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
 I don't want peace in the place to be broken. 

222
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,540
 From the chick part ... 

223
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
 From the stitching of the balla ... 

224
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
 You are responsible. 

225
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,480
 Deyyus! 

226
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,640
 Kulucahisar was determined by half. 

227
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,300
 He became a companion dog. 

228
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
 Don't worry, Dundar Bey. 

229
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,340
 With this informal ending ... 

230
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,860
 It has exceeded its limits. 

231
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,440
 The slap he smacked in my batur was drawn to the fly ... 

232
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,720
 When it came to Osman, he exceeded his limits. 

233
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,240
 Joyful... 

234
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
 When you look, you see a slap ... 

235
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,280
 I... 

236
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,360
 Migration routes ... 

237
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,860
 Exiles ... 

238
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,780
 I see the heads taken. 

239
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
 Elbet, we did not shit. 

240
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,080
 Of course. 

241
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,500
 We wrote your name on black cover. 

242
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,060
 Stop it. 

243
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
 In order to stop ... 

244
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,540
 We were all silent all the time ... 

245
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,880
 He slapped my valiant like a lion in the middle place like a pedophile. 

246
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,020
 My heart burns as I think of it. 

247
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,280
 Zöhre 

248
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,200
 Don't you know us? 

249
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,040
 Do you think that slap will stay with Alişar? 

250
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,020
 What is Batur missing from Osman? 

251
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,560
 Is it different from Osman Batur so that we can separate him? 

252
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,600
 Osman is also our son Batur. 

253
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
 Thank you Selcan Hatun. 

254
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 As you said, of course. 

255
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,240
 If we say stop ... 

256
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,020
 We call patience. 

257
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,040
 When the time comes, the beech's pusats ... 

258
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,660
 Those hands who try to wear a slap chain ... 

259
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
 It will cut out. 

260
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
 This is so known. 

261
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
 Hello, Shaykh Edebalı. 

262
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
 Hello, hello. 

263
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,940
 What's up? 

264
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,740
 So many men, Alişar Bey. 

265
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
 Our property is a prayer to order. 

266
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,720
 We are here for order. 

267
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
 At night, incidents happened. 

268
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
 Do you have any information? 

269
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 No ... 

270
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,220
 A few of my men were killed by jokes from the market. 

271
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
 Is there anything you hear? 

272
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,140
 Ablution ... 

273
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
 It purifies you of your sins ... 

274
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,480
 Now, with little fingers and inside your ears ... 

275
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
 The back of his hand and his neck ... 

276
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 Then wash your feet. 

277
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,360
 May Allah accept it. 

278
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,740
 Exist Osman. 

279
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,760
 Thank you. 

280
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,700
 Take it. 

281
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 Ya Allah. 

282
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,800
 Sons ... 

283
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
 Before you ask me ... 

284
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 Let me tell you ... 

285
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
 Our Prophet ... 

286
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 Hz. Muhammad's uncle ... 

287
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,240
 Hz. The wild who martyred Hamza ... 

288
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 How to come to faith ... 

289
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
 Hz. If it was wild ... 

290
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,680
 Listen to me... 

291
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,920
 You'll listen to me! 

292
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,900
 My child ... 

293
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,940
 Aybars ... 

294
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,460
 He was valiant. 

295
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
 But... 

296
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
 The uncle of our Prophet ... 

297
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
 Hz. Was he stout from Hamza? 

298
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
 Our Prophet ... 

299
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,340
 He was the killer of his uncle. 

300
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
 I mean a weird Bamsi ... 

301
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
 As long as there are valiant people like you ... 

302
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
 Who can do what to our case, Bamsı? 

303
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 O Osman. 

304
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 Sir, this time ... 

305
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,400
 From the fear of death ... 

306
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,980
 If he lies to us ... 

307
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,440
 We will understand it soon. 

308
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
 His first test will be tough. 

309
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
 Rest in peace. 

310
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,620
 We go to bed early, get up early. 

311
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
 The Prophet's ceremony is like this. 

312
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,820
 Hayre will not sleep you even asleep ... 

313
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,540
 Ear hole ... 

314
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,440
 We know the eye sharply. 

315
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
 Then your ... 

316
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,880
 You do not know that Osman Bey killed Kalanoz? 

317
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,820
 The death of the barreled shroud, such as kalanoz ... 

318
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,940
 Why is Alişar Bey overwhelming you? 

319
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,340
 Don't think I know he's doing business with Osman. 

320
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,420
 Do you have anything to do with this incident? 

321
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
 Walking with a valiant like Osman ... 

322
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,860
 Bahtiyarlı is. 

323
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
 Nothing to say about your eyes. 

324
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
 But it is a commandment 

325
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
 Eagles do not enter the cage ... 

326
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,760
 Lions do not fit in the forest, Alişar Bey. 

327
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
 The order of this land is asked from me. 

328
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
 I don't know the lion. 

329
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 Mongolian in Konya does not want turmoil. 

330
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,300
 The truth of what happened at night time is over ... 

331
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
 Allah knows Alişar Bey. 

332
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,720
 But I know that. 

333
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,600
 If you add water to the soil, slime ... 

334
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,820
 If you add blood ... 

335
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,740
 It becomes a homeland. 

336
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 If Osman killed that shroud ... 

337
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,180
 Good job. 

338
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,140
 It is a great valiant. 

339
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 Why is that clove twisted? 

340
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
 He must have been dehydrated. 

341
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,820
 Nobody thought of giving him water. 

342
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,940
 He faded. 

343
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
 May it be easy, ladies. 

344
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,300
 How long have I wanted to decorate my mansion's garden walls with tiles ... 

345
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,320
 I don't know the skillful as you. 

346
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
 What did our religion say ... 

347
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,740
 Hand over the safety to your city. 

348
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,280
 The same verse ... 

349
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
 When you rule, it continues as if you did not judge with justice. 

350
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,380
 Companionship of Bala Hatun ... 

351
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,360
 Isn't it like a favor, Gonca Hatun? 

352
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,680
 Both knowledge and skill ... 

353
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,880
 Hullo. 

354
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,120
 Hullo. 

355
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,380
 I will definitely entrust my mansion to you. 

356
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,220
 Bala Hatun. 

357
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 When our skilled allies come ... 

358
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 You talk about them, Alişar Bey. 

359
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
 My job is not to paint the mansion wall. 

360
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,800
 Alişar Bey 

361
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
 What have you got? 

362
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,540
 Kayı alps kidnapped Osman Bey from the soldiers. 

363
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
 You say bre weed! 

364
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,620
 Let me be my Sheikh. 

365
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,760
 Long live my daughter. 

366
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,300
 My Sheikh. 

367
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,420
 Tell me, girl. 

368
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,740
 Nizamettin delivered a news while Alişar Bey was leaving. 

369
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,220
 Osman said ... 

370
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,880
 He said he ran away from the soldiers. 

371
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
 Alişar Bey got angry and went away. 

372
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,720
 What happens 

373
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,660
 Alişar Bey 

374
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,220
 He arrested Osman Bey for the murder of Kalanoz. 

375
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,860
 Has he arrested? 

376
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,840
 So Osman Bey got rid of his hands. 

377
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,820
 There is one he knows. 

378
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,680
 I am Sheikh, if it happens to Osman Bey. 

379
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
 Bala! 

380
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,020
 How long have we been worried about the servant? 

381
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
 Everyone is entrusted to Allah. 

382
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
 You will worry about Osman ... 

383
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,820
 Take care of your own business. 

384
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,460
 Mixing! 

385
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,000
 Let's pour more. 

386
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
 You take good care of your fish. 

387
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
 They need me. 

388
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,520
 Taking good care of those who need me ... 

389
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,380
 I have it in my fit. 

390
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,900
 Under your tough look ... 

391
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,280
 You carry a compassionate soul, Alişar Bey. 

392
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
 You like these fish ... 

393
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,400
 You live in a small pool called Kulucahisar. 

394
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,660
 The same goes for you. 

395
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,600
 As much as you need our generosity ... 

396
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,860
 You definitely need us. 

397
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,140
 Princess... 

398
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
 To a smile ... 

399
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,600
 To a sweet word ... 

400
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,320
 I opened doors that are too big for you to imagine. 

401
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
 Trade is trade ... 

402
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,540
 Till the end... 

403
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
 Osman on the other hand ... 

404
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,180
 I'll surface your skin. 

405
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,300
 But one abuse between us ... 

406
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
 If a single shadow enters ... 

407
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,400
 Your soldiers still did not bring Osman Bey ... 

408
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,520
 I hope you haven't missed it. 

409
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,100
 Alişar Bey 

410
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
 Go to master Yannis now ... 

411
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
 Princess Sophia fell into Osman's trap. 

412
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
 Where are my soldiers? 

413
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,700
 I loosened his strings ... 

414
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,580
 They'll be coming soon. 

415
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
 Can't I hang you with that rope? 

416
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,500
 Soldiers! 

417
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,660
 I mean rebellion to my judgment? 

418
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
 With this dare ... 

419
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,460
 You issued a decree to the murderer. 

420
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,680
 I rely on his justice, Alişar Bey. 

421
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,060
 Now I have surrendered to his justice. 

422
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,140
 What do they mean? 

423
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,240
 Alişar Bey 

424
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,760
 What is that Sopiha? 

425
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,240
 Didn't you remember Salvador? 

426
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,120
 This is the first time I have seen this man in my life. 

427
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,820
 Is that so? 

428
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,380
 Let me remember then. 

429
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,360
 At your father's and your disposal ... 

430
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,740
 Pressing the New Market ... 

431
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,620
 The head of the Catalans is Salvador. 

432
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,280
 Is this true, Sophia? 

433
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
 How do you believe Osman's lies? 

434
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,760
 How will you prove your words? 

435
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,160
 Alişar Bey 

436
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,060
 The gold that we hit the market and seized ... 

437
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
 All of them are in my secret place ... 

438
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,700
 I am ready to go with your soldiers and give them all back to you. 

439
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,380
 Salvador's story is not over yet, Alişar Bey 

440
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
 There is actually more to it. 

441
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,600
 It is enough. 

442
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,360
 I can no longer bear this shamelessness. 

443
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,980
 I am going. 

444
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,320
 Stop, Sophia. 

445
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,800
 You asked for a court ... 

446
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
 Here's the court. 

447
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,980
 Soldiers! 

448
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,240
 Alişar Bey 

449
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,860
 Alişar Bey 

450
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,560
 Osman. 

451
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,900
 Leave it. 

452
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,600
 I want to learn everything you know. 

453
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,260
 Tell me all. 

454
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,300
 I've been walking the road for two days, I'm hungry for a piece of bread. 

455
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,320
 Sit down late. 

456
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,960
 Thank you brother. 

457
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,140
 He is deaf and dumb. 

458
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,940
 Innkeeper! 

459
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,100
 Prepare food for us! 

460
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,900
 Apturrahman Gazi. 

461
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,240
 If you take care of those who come in with Erkut ... 

462
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,180
 Obviously the gold is in the room. 

463
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
 Let's go to the room with Boğaç. 

464
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,340
 You know what you will get. 

465
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,040
 Let them attack first. 

466
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,520
 Force your wrist. 

467
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,880
 What do you think you're doing? 

468
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,680
 Can't I strangle you? 

469
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,260
 Sit down! 

470
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,480
 He is mine. 

471
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,200
 It was tasallut to my goods. 

472
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,420
 So the murderer of Yorgopolos ... 

473
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,160
 Sophia and Kalanoz. 

474
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,020
 Is that so? 

475
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,120
 A bandit Osman bought with gold. 

476
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,680
 He is slandering me in the armor of our holy religion. 

477
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,520
 Are you still silent, Mr. Alişar? 

478
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,620
 Your dreams with Yannis ... 

479
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,700
 Among the stones of Kulucahisar ... 

480
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,920
 Sophia to be crushed. 

481
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,140
 I am a witness of everything. 

482
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,400
 I am ready to testify before the Emperor. 

483
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,040
 There is so much evidence to prove that in the castle ... 

484
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
 Only with you ... 

485
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
 We have to break the door, Alişar Bey. 

486
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,160
 When this infamous game is over and back to the pen ... 

487
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,980
 Emperor my ... 

488
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,880
 And fear the sultan's anger, Alişar Bey. 

489
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,420
 You too, Salvador. 

490
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,060
 My anger ... 

491
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
 You will get your share. 

492
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,980
 Death from those like you ... 

493
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,540
 It's honor for me. 

494
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,620
 My Lord ... 

495
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,020
 I arrive as a martyr, Sophia. 

496
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,260
 This game ends here. 

497
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,740
 Kill me here ... 

498
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
 Or let me go Alişar Bey 

499
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
 We have a lot more to talk about. 

500
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,500
 Soldiers! 

501
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,120
 Throw it into the dungeon. 

502
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,260
 Get your hands off me. 

503
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,160
 Check! 

504
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,720
 My account is not finished with you and your boss Osman. 

505
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,800
 Alişar Bey 

506
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
 Salvador is now a Muslim. 

507
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,980
 And it is under my protection. 

508
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,780
 If you excuse me ... 

509
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,740
 Bring the gold of the New Market. 

510
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 I trust your word, Osman Bey. 

511
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,860
 Mr. Bamsı. 

512
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,440
 Let the thesis set out. 

513
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,160
 Thank you, Osman. 

514
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
 The best of the meat is for you. 

515
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,940
 Put the food in and out. 

516
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,380
 Alşar saying ... 

517
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,720
 The fatty bite of his voyage would have taken faith in the way. 

518
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,420
 He tries to rule Turkish with his money. 

519
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,020
 Your turn will come. 

520
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,800
 What would I say to Alişar Bey? 

521
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,540
 Sophia deceived us all. 

522
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,760
 Toxic language ... 

523
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,040
 It paralyzed both our mind and our heart. 

524
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
 My hunting companion ... 

525
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,720
 You would come like Yiğit Alişar Bey ... 

526
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,280
 I would tell you everything. 

527
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,840
 But even if I explain ... 

528
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,560
 He had tied his clairvoyance too far to understand. 

529
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,540
 All of them were for the peace of this land ... 

530
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,360
 Sophia poisoned us all. 

531
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,660
 Not just Sophia ... 

532
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,660
 He is also in Yannis. 

533
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,700
 I will take it away from that castle that he sheltered. 

534
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,380
 What if they will give you friendly ... 

535
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,300
 Or I'll take your lungs to shit. 

536
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,640
 Believe me. 

537
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,120
 You can remember my words well, Alişar Bey. 

538
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,160
 What Sophia is a simple fukara ... 

539
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,780
 Neither will his father, Yannis ... 

540
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,820
 It is an ordinary monk. 

541
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,800
 Mr. Osman 

542
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,760
 You're not just a valiant alp. 

543
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
 You are a clever and strong brain. 

544
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 With gentlemen like you ... 

545
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
 I revive this land. 

546
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,720
 I do not understand ... 

547
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,860
 Sheikh Edebalı ... 

548
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,360
 In a heap like you ... 

549
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,760
 How does she not give her daughter? 

550
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,720
 You are my brother, Osman Bey. 

551
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
 Bala Hatun also know that you have a heart. 

552
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,380
 Tell me what you will do. 

553
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,300
 To keep me here ... 

554
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,620
 Nobody's power is enough! 

555
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,300
 Do you hear me? 

556
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,980
 Sheikh Edebalı is a great scholar. 

557
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
 For her daughter like you ... 

558
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,240
 Resisting various kinds of ifa ... 

559
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,420
 A brave apricot brain ... 

560
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,940
 He must have a reason to turn it down. 

561
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,500
 lord 

562
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
 Bringing gold from Konya in the caravanserai ... 

563
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,160
 They had the Mongols sword. 

564
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,800
 How about you? 

565
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,960
 What do they mean, murdered? 

566
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
 In my land my men ... 

567
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,300
 Who dares to do this? 

568
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,260
 Guys I ... 

569
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,760
 What about the gold? 

570
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,560
 They took them all, sir. 

571
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,000
 Quick recruit soldiers. 

572
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,540
 They call everywhere. 

573
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,240
 Prepare my horse that will go to Kervansaray! 

574
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,360
 Quickly! 

575
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,360
 Betrayal, Osman Bey, has surrounded us. 

576
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,420
 They will pay for it. 

577
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,940
 Keep your heart fresh, Alişar Bey. 

578
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,660
 While embedding the fitna in Kulucahisar on the walls ... 

579
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,080
 You know I will be with you. 

580
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,020
 Raging horny dogs! 

581
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,040
 They think they will stop me by taking my Sophia. 

582
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,340
 To them this land ... 

583
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
 I'll be hell! 

584
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,640
 You will take my daughter out of the dungeon, Nizamettin! 

585
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,700
 You know Alişar's mansion best. 

586
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,940
 We will do our best, sir ... 

587
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,740
 If anything happens to my daughter ... 

588
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,480
 With that mansion ... 

589
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,100
 I'll burn you too ... 

590
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,460
 Know that! 

591
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,460
 I won't let Sophia's hair hurt, sir. 

592
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,640
 To them... 

593
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,640
 You will show who Yannis is. 

594
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,300
 My dumb bird ... 

595
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,900
 What did you bring me? 

596
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,840
 Osman's alps ... 

597
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,940
 They secretly entered Kervansaray ... 

598
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,760
 To Alişar Bey ... 

599
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,000
 They stole the gold brought by the Mongols, master Yannis. 

600
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,800
 You released your own death warrant, Osman! 

601
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,020
 Exit 

602
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,340
 What do you think, sir? 

603
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,100
 I am thinking of meeting with Alişar in Kervansaray. 

604
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,900
 My father will do new assignments, brother. 

605
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,400
 My working iron shines, my Batur. 

606
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,060
 Obviously my absorption does not want stasis. 

607
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
 But I wonder ... 

608
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,360
 I wonder who will give what task? 

609
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,420
 Duty is not requested at the Kayı ceremony ... 

610
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,080
 It is given. 

611
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,680
 The valiant who took the duty ... 

612
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,380
 He performs about him. 

613
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,880
 That's it. 

614
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,860
 You too are tired, too. 

615
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,720
 On the one hand, trade ... 

616
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,660
 On the one hand, the alpine head ... 

617
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,620
 No, I'm Batur? 

618
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,100
 Do you wish to be the head of the alpine? 

619
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,540
 Estafurullah brother. 

620
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,340
 I say the load is heavy. 

621
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,480
 Latife aside .. 

622
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,360
 The alpine head is a heavy armor Batur. 

623
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,520
 Especially apricot is even heavier. 

624
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,680
 But to a heaven whose blood is entrusted with his blood ... 

625
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,880
 It is necessary to give. 

626
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,920
 Thank you brother. 

627
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,180
 But the blood-flowing brave courage ... 

628
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,200
 Big blood flows cool. 

629
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,680
 If my father is going to make such a change ... 

630
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,100
 In my opinion, to take advantage of experience ... 

631
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,440
 Your assistant will appoint you. 

632
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 Good luck to you, I am Batur. 

633
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,700
 Daytime eye ... 

634
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,220
 While my men are mowing ... 

635
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,540
 What would you do, innkeeper? 

636
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,180
 Mr. Bey suddenly happened. 

637
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,280
 I did not see anything. 

638
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,820
 You eat my bread on my land ... 

639
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,020
 While my golds are stolen ... 

640
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
 You don't see it, take it! 

641
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,340
 Face whip! 

642
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,640
 We're not done with you, innkeeper! 

643
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,960
 They don't see either ... 

644
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,160
 They don't both hear. 

645
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,280
 Don't they know my wrath? 

646
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,280
 If the ground is split ... 

647
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,880
 If the sky collapses ... 

648
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,360
 I will find them. 

649
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,280
 I will find it. 

650
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,140
 Those who see the invisible ... 

651
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,260
 There are those who hear the inaudible. 

652
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
 Who are you, old man? 

653
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,240
 My name is Müneccin Apdül, sir. 

654
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,120
 He sees the deep ... 

655
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,840
 I let you know. 

656
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,500
 Take it! 

657
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,080
 You call those who do this! 

658
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,620
 Stop! 

659
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,140
 There are eyes that see ... 

660
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,460
 But he has no language to say. 

661
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,680
 What do you think about that? 

662
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,220
 I don't like the crowded man. 

663
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,720
 Whatever you will say is a thesis! 

664
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,360
 His ear is deaf ... 

665
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,000
 Tongue lal ... 

666
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,920
 But his eyes are eagles. 

667
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,720
 Who? 

668
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,980
 Is there someone like that? 

669
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,940
 Bey. 

670
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,240
 There is a grudge who has been here for years. 

671
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,320
 Where is she? 

672
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,780
 He lives in the courtyard. 

673
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,700
 Bring me a thesis. 

674
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,760
 Eat your last meal. 

675
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,720
 Who did this? 

676
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,520
 Are you ready to see the truth? 

677
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,020
 Alişar Bey 

678
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,160
 Kayi on. 

679
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,020
 So Apdul. 

680
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,240
 Our ears ... 

681
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,480
 Your name has never been stolen. 

682
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,900
 We deal with a lot of trouble. 

683
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,480
 Land us ... 

684
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,280
 Aka steal old man. 

685
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,580
 The gold you give shines. 

686
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,780
 But... 

687
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,840
 Your baht looks dark. 

688
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,060
 I'll see a mansion. 

689
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,640
 Misty roads ... 

690
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
 Behind the foggy slopes ... 

691
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,700
 Paving... 

692
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,240
 An imposing mansion. 

693
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,200
 And from here ... 

694
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,580
 A prisoner preparing to escape. 

695
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,600
 Delicate like a flower outside ... 

696
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,520
 But the inside is predatory. 

697
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,040
 And a wild prisoner. 

698
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,440
 But you don't know anything. 

699
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,840
 My mansion ... 

700
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:31,620
 It is even sheltered from the sultan's palace in Istanbul. 

701
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,560
 Don't forget Alişar Bey ... 

702
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,160
 The chain holds the captive. 

703
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
 But his order ... 

704
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,660
 Betrayal spoils. 

705
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,300
 All that many men ... 

706
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,840
 While keeping watch ... 

707
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,540
 Not captive ... 

708
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,700
 I was killed ... 

709
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,880
 Even his soul cannot come out. 

710
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,180
 You will not forget what I said again, Alişar Bey. 

711
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,060
 A way out 

712
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,620
 If you seek a remedy for your problem ... 

713
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,580
 I will also be in Kartalkaya. 

714
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,040
 Hayrola princess did not eat? 

715
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,780
 Doesn't it look like the ones in the palace? 

716
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,160
 Good luck, Bala Hatun. 

717
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,080
 If it is easy, come to Aygül Hatun. 

718
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,140
 Your job is difficult. 

719
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
 To make two pots and earn three cents ... 

720
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,480
 You pour sweat from morning to evening. 

721
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,680
 The important thing is halal earnings, Aygül Hatun. 

722
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,320
 The contemptuous eye does not see the beauty. 

723
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,980
 It is necessary to look beautiful to see the beauty. 

724
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,220
 Wrap it here, two pots. 

725
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,020
 May your risk be less or our share. 

726
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,380
 I can't get your money, Burçin Hatun. 

727
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,340
 Why? 

728
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,460
 Don't you like us? 

729
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,780
 Estafuruallah. 

730
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
 Osman Bey's memory is great. 

731
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,880
 We will not give you a sale, but a gift. 

732
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,760
 You should accept this, Aygül Hatun. 

733
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,180
 I painted it myself, I had something that made me very happy. 

734
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,820
 The colors are so vivid from him. 

735
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,520
 I wish you a present. 

736
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:17,900
 Selamun aleykum. 

737
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,460
 Hello, hello. 

738
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,300
 Bala Hatun ... 

739
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,080
 My Osman Bey wants to see you. 

740
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,920
 They have something to say. 

741
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,400
 Bala! 

742
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,400
 Don't you know my Sheikh doesn't want you to meet? 

743
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,380
 Are you really going? 

744
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,940
 Osman Bey's head is in trouble because of us. 

745
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,180
 My father doesn't want to see him. 

746
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,700
 Osman Bey would not call it if it was not important, Gonca. 

747
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,780
 I have to arrive and learn. 

748
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,840
 It was broken and gone. 

749
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
 Don't worry, there are better things. 

750
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,460
 It was already milking. 

751
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,600
 Osman. 

752
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,180
 Thank God my eyes saw you safe and sound. 

753
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,040
 My smile is beautiful. 

754
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,080
 I love the rose face. 

755
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,780
 My sun. 

756
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,360
 I ate inside. 

757
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,320
 Tell me, what happens, Osman? 

758
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,860
 Sophia the snake is where it deserves. 

759
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,040
 In Alişar's dungeon. 

760
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,800
 I will stay away from you for a while. 

761
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,720
 But I don't know how long this will take. 

762
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,320
 You still need to be awake. 

763
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,560
 Alişar Bey turns on and turns over and trusts him. 

764
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,220
 Her impermeability is evident in all aspects ... 

765
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,100
 We do not trust. 

766
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,240
 We don't worry. 

767
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
 What's boring your heart, Bala? 

768
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,700
 Osman... 

769
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,140
 While being both patient and patient ... 

770
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,300
 If I have another suitor ... 

771
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,520
 If my father sees fit ... 

772
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,780
 I'm afraid Osman. 

773
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,100
 Your name is stamped in my heart, Bala. 

774
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,520
 I do not lean towards anyone else, nor do I split you into someone else. 

775
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,440
 Do not be afraid! 

776
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,640
 Until he smelled his silk hair ... 

777
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,720
 Let it be your head. 

778
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,740
 Every time I prostrate before Allah, your name is poured from my lips. 

779
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,880
 My prayer is that ... 

780
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,200
 May he entrust us to each other during our lifetime. 

781
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,240
 God willing. 

782
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,540
 May Allah help you. 

783
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,780
 My prayers are with you. 

784
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,140
 But my father doesn't want us to meet. 

785
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,860
 So don't call me. 

786
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,320
 Understood 

787
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,300
 Don't bother you. 

788
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,480
 You pray. 

789
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,140
 My armor is your prayers. 

790
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,200
 Father! 

791
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,660
 That dog called Osman would do it again! 

792
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,860
 Fortunately your father is with anyone who can harm you ... 

793
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,640
 He put a servant. 

794
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,800
 Father. 

795
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,180
 When Alişar Bey finds out that I have run away, he will follow me. 

796
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
 How are we going to stop him? 

797
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,720
 Alişar Bey 

798
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,720
 He met Abdul. 

799
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,480
 He even told him that his prisoner would escape. 

800
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,860
 Who's that? 

801
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:35,060
 I am the astrologer who will make Alişar Bey our puppet. 

802
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,260
 One name is Apdül ... 

803
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,920
 Other name... 

804
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,160
 Yannis 

805
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,540
 Yannis 

806
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,940
 May God accept him. 

807
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,420
 I hope my daughter. 

808
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
 Gather your sustenance, little souls. 

809
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,980
 Let's collect it. 

810
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,520
 They are countless. 

811
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,280
 But... 

812
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,600
 There is one in the beginning .. 

813
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,040
 Wherever he goes ... 

814
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,180
 Others follow him. 

815
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,860
 What about you Bala? 

816
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,960
 Are you like ants? 

817
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,540
 You have a saying to me. 

818
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,320
 Just tell me. 

819
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,340
 My Sheikh ... 

820
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,540
 I would like to say what Osman Bey did if confiscated. 

821
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,340
 And Bala my daughter ... 

822
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,540
 How do you know what Osman Bey did? 

823
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,980
 My Sheikh ... 

824
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
 You do not accept Osman Bey ... 

825
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:20,240
 He told me to be aware of the situation ... 

826
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,020
 He ensured that Sophia was thrown into the dungeon. 

827
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,280
 It won't come to us for a while. 

828
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,440
 You look at your trade ... 

829
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,760
 But do not leave the measure, he said. 

830
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,180
 Not even my consent ... 

831
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,400
 Are you meeting with Osman, Bala? 

832
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,460
 Is it my daughter who did this? 

833
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,720
 I'll ask again! 

834
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,480
 Breaking my word and ... 

835
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,580
 Whoever I say do not ... 

836
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,240
 Ignoring my consent ... 

837
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,160
 Are you? 

838
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,840
 Silence... 

839
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,940
 It comes from confession ... 

840
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,420
 Obviously you are. 

841
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,880
 Obviously you ... 

842
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,880
 It doesn't give us dignity ... 

843
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,880
 By his darkening ... 

844
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,940
 You go after what you know right. 

845
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,300
 Father! 

846
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,540
 Do not say that. 

847
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,900
 Now go think Bala. 

848
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,220
 Think ... 

849
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
 Before we break with us ... 

850
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,340
 You'll come back from wrong. 

851
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,140
 Thank goodness we were full. 

852
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,700
 Give it to those who do not have Allah. 

853
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
 Amen amen. 

854
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:08,660
 When will we get this circumcision out of the way, Bamsı? 

855
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,060
 What sunnah? 

856
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:21,140
 Is it easy to bring such a joy and become a Muslim? 

857
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,420
 You will lie under the knife ... 

858
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,340
 Under the knife! 

859
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,280
 Sons! 

860
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,760
 Let's get this done tomorrow morning. 

861
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:48,840
 Tomorrow? 

862
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,640
 What tomorrow? 

863
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,560
 Okay, Bamsı Bey ... 

864
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,780
 Will this be the name of Salvador? 

865
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,240
 I Uthman ... 

866
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,400
 From now on... 

867
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,760
 Your name... 

868
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,140
 May Ebubekir Sıddık. 

869
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:28,820
 That... 

870
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,700
 May you keep up with your religion. 

871
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,900
 This is such a conscious son. 

872
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,240
 In Sıddık's circumcision tournament ... 

873
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,640
 We knock down the corral bird. 

874
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,680
 Who am Bamsı? 

875
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,040
 Thank you 

876
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,800
 I Uthman ... 

877
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,780
 What are you going to do with all these spoils? 

878
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,320
 Muslim does not matter non-Muslim ... 

879
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,880
 We will deliver the sentence to the stranger. 

880
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,340
 We will deliver and divide ... 

881
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,780
 Let the sentence be hope for the world. 

882
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,620
 Thank you Osman. 

883
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,040
 Boran brother! 

884
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,680
 You are in the bosom of ... 

885
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,960
 May our pleasure be fulfilled. 

886
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,900
 Thank you sir. 

887
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,840
 I wish my brave ... 

888
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,320
 Hullo. 

889
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,120
 Thank you sir. 

890
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,860
 Look, I got these threads today. 

891
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,400
 What beautiful embroidery turns into your hands. 

892
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,980
 Look at the beauty of that green, that blue. 

893
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,200
 Bala. 

894
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:41,740
 Balam. 

895
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,440
 Don't worry like that ... 

896
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,400
 It will pass. 

897
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,580
 Will it pass Gonca? 

898
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:53,460
 Do you think my father's anger towards me passes? 

899
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,700
 Elbet will pass. 

900
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,220
 Don't you know how much she loves you? 

901
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,140
 I know. 

902
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,700
 I'm afraid I know that. 

903
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,500
 I broke your words. 

904
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
 My dad won't forgive me easily. 

905
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,780
 Until I find a way and take your heart ... 

906
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,600
 Every breath will burn my lung, Gonca. 

907
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,720
 How does it escape? 

908
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:50,260
 I asked you! 

909
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:51,760
 How does it escape? 

910
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
 Sir, this job was done by an insider. 

911
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,160
 There is no other explanation for this. 

912
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,300
 Do you know what you're saying? 

913
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
 The name for this is betrayal. 

914
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,960
 The chain keeps the prisoner ... 

915
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,220
 But his order ... 

916
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,220
 Betrayal spoils. 

917
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,800
 I have a minor in Kervansaray. 

918
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,640
 The name of Kartal in Kartalkaya is also Apdül. 

919
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,540
 Find it now and bring it to me. 

920
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,540
 I will fulfill your command, sir. 

921
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,960
 The object is in front of me. 

922
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,920
 But your mind is somewhere else. 

923
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,240
 What do you think so deep? 

924
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:50,740
 I think of my place, babe. 

925
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,500
 Rose of my heart garden ... 

926
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:56,560
 I think of Aygül. 

927
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,700
 What happened to Aygül? 

928
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,640
 Alişar Bey 

929
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,920
 It attacks its essence by hand. 

930
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,860
 It attacks us with the word of the shroud ... 

931
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,700
 It is not enough to come to my room ... 

932
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,600
 Slap my kid. 

933
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,780
 Aygul ... 

934
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,040
 My rose is my rosebud. 

935
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:23,520
 There is no consent for my child to fade in the garden of Alişar Bey. 

936
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,860
 I will unravel this knot. 

937
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,060
 Tomorrow is important. 

938
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:32,420
 The path is clear in your mind ... 

939
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,760
 But you don't say. 

940
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,860
 Let me tell you then I am Zöhre. 

941
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,880
 A new order will come to Oba ... 

942
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:45,140
 We will be so united that ... 

943
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,840
 Not Alişar ... 

944
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,460
 If Mongolian comes to the legendary language ... 

945
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,700
 It does not matter. 

946
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,960
 One of my nephews Gündüz ... 

947
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:00,020
 Next to me is my son Batur. 

948
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,080
 Osman is like a mountain behind me. 

949
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,960
 Osman. 

950
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:13,340
 Does your ear hear from your mouth, sir? 

951
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,880
 Hearing chick. 

952
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,700
 I will give him such a duty tomorrow ... 

953
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,180
 Both the place in the plague will change ... 

954
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
 The burden will become heavier, but ... 

955
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,360
 I know that he will succeed. 

956
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,800
 You trust a madman like Osman ... 

957
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,220
 I think I'll think again, sir. 

958
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,160
 Nothing to think about, chick. 

959
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,840
 Tomorrow... 

960
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,180
 After the assignment I will give him ... 

961
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:53,860
 I'll ask him something like that ... 

962
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,780
 Kara Osman both ... 

963
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,720
 It will tie our family more tightly ... 

964
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,960
 And that madness ... 

965
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,240
 I will restrain. 

966
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:07,740
 Thus... 

967
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,820
 We will be level. 

968
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,520
 Nobody can stand before us anymore. 

969
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,880
 Especially son ... 

970
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,640
 Why is your face so cloudy? 

971
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,400
 You have a problem. 

972
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,760
 There are aunt. 

973
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,160
 I have a problem. 

974
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,880
 Let me take care of it. 

975
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,940
 Let's talk to Aygül, aunt ... 

976
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:43,020
 Don't let Alişar walker. 

977
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,840
 Emmim does not give Aygül without her consent. 

978
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,200
 Talk, give up this job. 

979
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,080
 Mongolia holds a separate bowl separately to the shroud. 

980
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,620
 Let the devil see your face. 

981
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,900
 All kinds of misery are expected from him. 

982
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:59,880
 It will enter our daughter and our family will take our daughter. 

983
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,820
 What should we do, aunt? 

984
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:04,220
 Shall we make the snake with us? 

985
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,840
 This is not a matter of heart. 

986
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:10,220
 This is a matter of power. 

987
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:12,220
 In the right lesson ... 

988
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:13,740
 It does not suit. 

989
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,500
 After Aygül says ok, there is nothing to do. 

990
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,240
 It is true aunt. 

991
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,280
 If Alişar receives the genealogy Aygül ... 

992
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,880
 Not just our family ... 

993
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,740
 Our obese also has a fever. 

994
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,940
 It would haunt everything. 

995
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:41,180
 If anything I can, I will stop. 

996
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:44,860
 But you're right. 

997
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,540
 Our hands are tied without the consent of Aygül. 

998
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,540
 Rocked with my fury ... 

999
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,320
 I am Osman, who surrounds him with compassion. 

1000
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,340
 May Allah give you according to your heart. 

1001
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:02,140
 Tell your heart about your aunt. 

1002
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
 What is the climate in your heart? 

1003
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,440
 One side of me is an aunty river. 

1004
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,980
 The mountains want to cross the plains. 

1005
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,600
 One side of me is ... 

1006
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
 My arm is like a broken wing. 

1007
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:23,620
 I don't have to. 

1008
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,900
 I want the heart tomorrow ... 

1009
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,960
 Without being one with the person he loves ... 

1010
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,840
 This duality does not go away. 

1011
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,060
 I'll take Bala and come to her aunt. 

1012
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,200
 I'm patient. 

1013
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
 Sheikh Edebalı has not settle for now. 

1014
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,180
 But one day he will settle. 

1015
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,440
 I'll say father and kiss his hand. 

1016
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,520
 Hopefully son. 

1017
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,320
 When you say be ... 

1018
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,680
 our hearts ... 

1019
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,620
 Filling with the light of faith ... 

1020
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
 With the name 99 of Allah Almighty. 

1021
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,180
 Valiant gentlemen of beech ... 

1022
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,840
 To be alive ... 

1023
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,720
 It needs to be refreshed. 

1024
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,540
 Therefore... 

1025
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,300
 As the deputy of Kayi ... 

1026
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,640
 I consider new assignments. 

1027
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,720
 From the markets of Kayı oba ... 

1028
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,520
 From their caravans and money ... 

1029
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,980
 I do not doubt his morality ... 

1030
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,600
 My nephew Gündüz Bey is responsible. 

1031
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,800
 This is yours, sir. 

1032
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:05,780
 Alpineness, bravery, ... 

1033
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:09,100
 Bravery is courage. 

1034
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,240
 As the alpine head of the rock alps ... 

1035
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:19,380
 I appointed my favorite baby Batur Bey. 

1036
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,820
 Thank you, my father. 

1037
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,560
 As for Selcan Hatun's obasi ... 

1038
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,420
 The number of apricots would increase considerably ... 

1039
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,780
 Oba is not easy to handle. 

1040
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,600
 Knowing the honor, taking gentleness ... 

1041
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,960
 It is necessary to know the apricot. 

1042
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,860
 So as my chief assistant ... 

1043
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,040
 My brother Ertuğurul was cooked in Gazi's stove ... 

1044
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,900
 I appointed my nephew Osman. 

1045
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,880
 This is yours, sir. 

1046
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,160
 Our heavenly bed ... 

1047
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,900
 For our believer obese ... 

1048
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,320
 New duties ... 

1049
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,980
 No and ... 

1050
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,780
 Bring a kut. 

1051
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,460
 My hunting companions! 

1052
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,400
 My bloody scouts! 

1053
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,400
 This is you hunting season ... 

1054
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,400
 We will open early. 

1055
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,680
 Spring flowers without saying hello to the sun ... 

1056
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,900
 Before the babies are weaned ... 

1057
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,440
 If you know the blood season has come. 

1058
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,880
 The shadow of the sultan ... 

1059
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,720
 To the banner of Alişar Bey ... 

1060
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,660
 To the flowing water ... 

1061
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,700
 Let your anger be engraved in your soil. 

1062
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,620
 Those who hurt me ... 

1063
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,180
 Let them know that I will hurt so much. 

1064
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,600
 Those who put fire on my stove ... 

1065
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:57,320
 Let them know that I will ash her bed. 

1066
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:02,280
 Now go puking blood on them. 

1067
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,120
 Show what Alişar Bey's gadget is! 

1068
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,240
 You will download the apricots where you find them. 

1069
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:27,740
 No, Ayşe Hatun? 

1070
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:29,500
 You look like you look at something beautiful. 

1071
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,240
 I'll take care of my stout. 

1072
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,760
 As I look at it, I open my day. 

1073
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,320
 Süleyman Shah also saw his majesty. 

1074
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:49,940
 The eyes of my eyes ... 

1075
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:51,800
 I Aisha. 

1076
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,420
 If a valiant emerged from the day ... 

1077
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,120
 Behind me is the stance of a mountain like you. 

1078
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:13,080
 May Allah bring his power to work. 

1079
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:15,100
 Hopefully, chick. 

1080
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,720
 Thank goodness we've prepared a car item. 

1081
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,580
 Let's get to the market now ... 

1082
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,500
 Let's get our share of what our risk is. 

1083
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
 Don't take this off your neck ... 

1084
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:40,460
 The word of Allah. 

1085
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,520
 May protect you. 

1086
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:53,560
 Thank you, chick. 

1087
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
 Take care. 

1088
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:05,900
 Add your own. 

1089
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,080
 My prayer is with you. 

1090
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,220
 Whoever left God bless. 

1091
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,840
 Shall I give you a secret, a black mane? 

1092
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,360
 Nobody knows this. 

1093
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:13,640
 You know! 

1094
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,640
 I swore an oath ... 

1095
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,780
 I am very ahead ... 

1096
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,540
 Maybe... 

1097
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,940
 Before born. 

1098
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:30,100
 I said my name is Osman! 

1099
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:33,100
 I want this world ... 

1100
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,800
 I will print my seal ... 

1101
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,260
 I will scratch my name. 

1102
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,340
 They said Hamlık ... 

1103
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,660
 They said toying ... 

1104
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,980
 They said right. 

1105
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,800
 But those who say madness ... 

1106
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,400
 They don't know ... 

1107
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:01,700
 The enchantment is in the blood in my veins. 

1108
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:06,420
 Osman has not started running yet. 

1109
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:10,300
 I'm stepping further. 

1110
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,780
 When the time comes ... 

1111
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,920
 Kara Osman pace in the field ... 

1112
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,120
 Sentence world heroes ... 

1113
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,540
 Sentence gentlemen ... 

1114
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,360
 They will wait at the door of my room. 

1115
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,120
 Where my hand lies ... 

1116
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,860
 The victims will be cut! 

1117
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:53,220
 What happened to you? 

1118
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
 We will watch the games ... 

1119
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,960
 Belle will ... 

1120
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,360
 We will restrain our ego. 

1121
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:08,740
 We will see who is friend, who is enemy. 

1122
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,440
 Before marking the wild as an enemy ... 

1123
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:15,340
 We will clean our inside. 

1124
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,560
 We will clear our hearts. 

1125
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,960
 On the earth ... 

1126
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,040
 Wherever we press ... 

1127
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,900
 We will bring justice ... 

1128
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,680
 Without wondering from the word of Allah ... 

1129
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,880
 We will stay on a straight path. 

1130
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,380
 Take the heart of our heart, our Bala ... 

1131
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,120
 We will act our bed in the rose garden. 

1132
01:48:55,540 --> 01:48:57,540
 You can be a witness, Karayel. 

1133
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:01,660
 I swear ... 

1134
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,820
 Those who set up games for us ... 

1135
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,560
 I will break your games! 

1136
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,880
 By glorifying the truth ... 

1137
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,720
 All over the world ... 

1138
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,560
 I will provide justice. 

1139
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,280
 Other than my Lord ... 

1140
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,280
 Nobody .. 

1141
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:19,860
 I will not bow! 

1142
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:50,620
 Hello 

1143
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
 And hey hello 

1144
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,960
 Is there a destruction, Sheikh Edebalı? 

1145
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,000
 Buyur Alişar Bey 

1146
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,880
 It is precious since it holds the enclosure. 

1147
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:42,040
 Erenler serdarı ... 

1148
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,460
 Our Pir Ahmed Yesevi, 

1149
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,280
 Wisdom are. 

1150
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:53,160
 Just as psoriasis protects the pearl ... 

1151
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,040
 The book also protects the skin. 

1152
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,860
 Obviously you have something to say, Alişar Bey. 

1153
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,380
 There is. 

1154
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,800
 I say thank you for our powers. 

1155
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,840
 Let's produce and sell ourselves. 

1156
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,540
 I don't have the environment that you have either ... 

1157
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:18,580
 You are also the craftsman who I do not have. 

1158
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,940
 What is Murad? 

1159
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,680
 If we were one, we would be a clan ... 

1160
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,040
 In this business, trade is asked from us. 

1161
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:51,620
 My nephew is going to be dry this year. 

1162
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:54,460
 If there is no profit ... 

1163
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,020
 Summer will not find animals. 

1164
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,520
 Let's go up to the mountains and look at the plateau. 

1165
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,280
 Thank you 

1166
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,840
 But this will put our immigration ... 

1167
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,640
 Alishar does not allow. 

1168
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,680
 He is very afraid of us. 

1169
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:17,620
 Afraid. 

1170
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,780
 He is afraid, but he wants Aygül from you. 

1171
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,840
 He needs your friendship. 

1172
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:28,160
 My biggest regret ... 

1173
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,620
 My daughter is from Aygül. 

1174
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
 I will not give my daughter to her. 

1175
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,560
 Alişar Bey 

1176
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,880
 You know our past ... 

1177
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:49,140
 He will not be able to put a profanity in his mind ... 

1178
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,700
 Don't let the last thing worry you. 

1179
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:54,700
 I'll be shielded by sentences. 

1180
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:59,080
 If necessary, I stack the army on the market. 

1181
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,060
 As long as you accept the partnership. 

1182
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,400
 Giving without ... 

1183
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,720
 Alişar Bey is dedicated to those who do nothing. 

1184
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,560
 In return for this partnership ... 

1185
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,580
 What do you want? 

1186
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:16,760
 Strong alliances ... 

1187
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:19,160
 First of all, from the bond of life ... 

1188
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:23,140
 Then it passes through the bloodstream. 

1189
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:32,160
 That's why ... 

1190
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,480
 God's order... 

1191
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:38,180
 With the prophet's tribe ... 

1192
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,680
 Your daughter Bala ... 

1193
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,360
 I would like to myself. 

1194
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,860
 My Aygül ... 

1195
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:52,800
 It is a delicate flower. 

1196
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,280
 In this political storm ... 

1197
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,320
 I worry about it fading. 

1198
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:01,460
 According to the eyes ... 

1199
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:04,540
 A girl like Alişar is not given a girl. 

1200
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,220
 I think so, my cousin. 

1201
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,920
 Me too. 

1202
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,680
 But the word came out of the mouth once ... 

1203
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,680
 I held a Kavil ... 

1204
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,560
 I promised... 

1205
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:25,060
 There is only one way to return from this word. 

1206
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,880
 The benefit of beech ... 

1207
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,860
 For the peace of our obese ... 

1208
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,160
 My daughter Aygül ... 

1209
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:36,380
 I would like to give it to you. 

1210
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:07,180
 I say I won't boast but ... 

1211
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:08,880
 It was beautiful. 

1212
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:12,240
 Aygül will decorate your bride's head with these. 

1213
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:19,120
 You have a situation. 

1214
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,400
 Pour the inside. 

1215
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:23,500
 My father... 

1216
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,040
 He does not trust Alişar Bey. 

1217
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:31,180
 He did not want this marriage because he did not think we would be happy. 

1218
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:34,820
 Isn't that good, Aygül? 

1219
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:39,860
 I know you don't have a heart in that guy either. 

1220
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:42,980
 What should I do, Burçin? 

1221
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,960
 You tell... 

1222
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:48,540
 What did Osman want but stood back? 

1223
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,020
 Shrugged. 

1224
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:55,780
 Bala will not give up Hatun. 

1225
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,600
 If not today tomorrow ... 

1226
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,200
 It will surely bring you to the oba. 

1227
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,100
 Not necessarily will. 

1228
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,100
 What will Aygül do? 

1229
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,900
 Osman and Bala are like doves in front of me every day ... 

1230
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,880
 I will distribute kirman at their wedding. 

1231
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:32,020
 Then when they have kids ... 

1232
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,800
 Cranberry sherbet. 

1233
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,780
 I can't bear it. 

1234
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,300
 This kills me slowly every day. 

1235
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,660
 Although my father gives up, I do not give up. 

1236
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,140
 I marry Alişar Bey. 

1237
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:00,100
 I'll be the starboard brain wife. 

1238
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,600
 What if Obama is useful? 

1239
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,700
 I don't care beyond that. 

1240
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,960
 After my heart did not like it ... 

1241
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:15,780
 Who is it? 

1242
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:18,580
 Kader Aygül. 

1243
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,540
 Destiny or Burçin. 

1244
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,100
 But if I stay ... 

1245
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:31,180
 It will not fall beyond my agony. 

1246
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:54,640
 Let's take a breath, the Alps. 

1247
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,880
 Protect Gündüz Bey! 

1248
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,900
 Mr. Gündüz! 

1249
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,380
 Are you available, Selcan Hatun? 

1250
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:56,660
 Here you are, Zöhre Hatun. 

1251
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:14,940
 Babes made cuttings. 

1252
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:18,540
 This is your share of your meal. 

1253
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:23,020
 Thanks to the health of the women. 

1254
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,480
 Certain cutting excuses ... 

1255
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:33,980
 You have a problem, too. 

1256
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,040
 There are. 

1257
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,620
 Has. 

1258
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,760
 But I think about how I say it. 

1259
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:48,660
 If you say that there is no marriage, you can say straight ahead. 

1260
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,260
 Selcan Hatun. 

1261
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:54,440
 You know... 

1262
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,740
 We talked about Aygül with Alişar Bey. 

1263
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:59,200
 Yes I know. 

1264
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,840
 It is as if it is necessary. 

1265
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,580
 Dündar Bey is also hesitant. 

1266
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:07,580
 The girl does not want to burn her head. 

1267
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,040
 But he made a promise ... 

1268
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,760
 I don't know how to turn. 

1269
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:12,640
 sayings. 

1270
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:15,880
 It is an angelic angel that you promised. 

1271
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,920
 Neither can she be trusted and promised. 

1272
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
 You say so ... 

1273
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,780
 The opposite is the huge starboard. 

1274
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,320
 If we say we are not giving the girl ... 

1275
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:29,760
 Zulmunden gets all his share of oba. 

1276
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,860
 It is a pity. 

1277
02:02:32,860 --> 02:02:34,380
 Zöhre ... 

1278
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:37,740
 Let me say something you have in mind ... 

1279
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,600
 Say we can go over it. 

1280
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,180
 I say ... 

1281
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,940
 Only Osman can save Aygül from this cender. 

1282
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:52,620
 Selcan Hatun come and be the front leg ... 

1283
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:56,660
 Let's tie Osman and Aygül's head. 

1284
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:03,780
 Osman should not be devastated by this desperate love. 

1285
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:07,080
 Also, our daughter's fortune does not darken. 

1286
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,160
 Only you solve this job. 

1287
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,780
 No you intend ... 

1288
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:16,300
 Evil comes to us and Zöhre. 

1289
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:22,420
 Aygül is the baby of our eyes, of course ... 

1290
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:25,260
 But Osman ... 

1291
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:27,680
 Osman is the pillar of this oba. 

1292
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:30,760
 As for what he says ... 

1293
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:35,100
 It is too complicated. 

1294
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,240
 Thus... 

1295
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,320
 We keep our obese. 

1296
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:51,660
 I know your heart is in Bala Hatun, but ... 

1297
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:55,520
 Osman did not give you the literary girl. 

1298
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:58,740
 You won't hurt yourself more. 

1299
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:06,580
 Speak to you, my nephew. 

1300
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:09,460
 What do you say? 

1301
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,500
 Emmi ... 

1302
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:17,260
 Is there any destim, sir? 

1303
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,480
 Come 

1304
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:25,700
 Beyim Gündüz Bey ... 

1305
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,020
 Ambushed. 

1306
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:31,420
 They took Ertuğurul Bey's car. 

1307
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,680
 Deposit it quickly. 

1308
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:43,980
 Be a thesis! 

1309
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:53,560
 Set up a stove to brand. 

1310
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,800
 It is necessary to remove the arrow. 

1311
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:14,320
 Brother... 

1312
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:25,420
 Brother... 

1313
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:28,480
 Who does this to you during the day? 

1314
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,520
 I will drown those who have done this to you in their blood. 

1315
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,220
 Brother! 

1316
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:14,760
 Brother! 

1317
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:16,740
 Brother! 

1318
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:43,000
 Trade... 

1319
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,820
 Production and market ... 

1320
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,180
 Alişar Bey is important. 

1321
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,840
 We do this job ... 

1322
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,320
 May the Muslim produce his own ... 

1323
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:55,720
 We do so that he does not need the void. 

1324
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:58,440
 We have the same purpose, my Sheikh. 

1325
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:03,020
 I say let's partner because of that. 

1326
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:06,860
 In addition, if you give the dastur ... 

1327
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:10,180
 I would like your folks to decorate my mansion with tiles. 

1328
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:18,240
 Let's get to Bala. 

1329
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:22,280
 Bala ... 

1330
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:24,420
 Dord finishing ... 

1331
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,960
 He was brought up with ahi ceremony. 

1332
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:31,420
 His trick is according to the lodge. 

1333
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:35,780
 Not according to the mansion. 

1334
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:39,060
 You say that this land ... 

1335
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:41,220
 You command the property. 

1336
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:43,100
 Tableware is wide ... 

1337
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:45,800
 My man's crowd ... 

1338
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,560
 Your load is heavy. 

1339
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:52,460
 Bala is not for you. 

1340
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:56,180
 There is no consent. 

1341
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,880
 You know. 

1342
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,720
 That the pusat in my waist doesn't cut ... 

1343
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:26,380
 Your Sheikh cuts your consent. 

1344
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,480
 Whatever you say. 

1345
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:36,240
 But you're still a thinker. 

1346
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,200
 My offer is always valid. 

1347
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:52,660
 Being a groom to a heavenly man like you ... 

1348
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,160
 It is before becoming a starboard. 

1349
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:59,740
 You should know with one word ... 

1350
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:01,640
 My world changes ... 

1351
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,400
 My darkness is enlightened. 

1352
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:15,820
 God be my victim, I am Gündüz ... 

1353
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,680
 I Uthman ... 

1354
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:23,800
 Calm down, brother. 

1355
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:28,280
 Mother Gündüz, is my brother alive? 

1356
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:47,800
 It breathes. 

1357
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:52,120
 It gets heavy but ... 

1358
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,940
 Thank God it's not breathless. 

1359
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:01,120
 May my Lord forgive him. 

1360
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,920
 Do not burn our hearts. 

1361
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:07,860
 God, the guy goes like a mountain. 

1362
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:11,940
 God forgive him for me. 

1363
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:16,120
 Patience, my daughter. 

1364
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:17,660
 Roast the iron! 

1365
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:23,320
 Grow thesis glands with boiled water. 

1366
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:25,800
 Aunt... 

1367
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:28,380
 Tell me, will my brother survive? 

1368
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,800
 May you be prepared for anything, Osman. 

1369
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,460
 Your brain is hit before your eyes ... 

1370
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:03,000
 What do you get? 

1371
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:05,320
 Say what you get to me! 

1372
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,980
 Osman Bey ... 

1373
02:11:07,980 --> 02:11:09,720
 If Cenk would have given our lives to our brain ... 

1374
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:12,040
 How many people did you not see their faces? 

1375
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:14,160
 They were in the distance, shot and ran away. 

1376
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,140
 They flew without realizing what it was. 

1377
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:21,140
 Whatever the poison needs ... 

1378
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:22,800
 Do the best. 

1379
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:25,820
 The drug is the drug, the doctor is the doctor. 

1380
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:28,260
 I'll get them all. 

1381
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,520
 As long as my nephew is fine. 

1382
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:34,980
 To me... 

1383
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,800
 He is entrusted to my brother. 

1384
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:53,780
 You can control yourself, nephew! 

1385
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:56,840
 Time is the time to be benign. 

1386
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,520
 Calm down. 

1387
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,300
 How can I calm down? 

1388
02:12:00,540 --> 02:12:03,260
 How can I calm down while my brother is dealing with his life? 

1389
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:08,120
 Which jackal has been attacked by our herd? 

1390
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,460
 If you have a doubt that my nephew knows ... 

1391
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:13,680
 Say, well. 

1392
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:30,720
 We came to a difficult place ... 

1393
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:33,220
 It is close to the heart. 

1394
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:42,640
 I Bismillahirahmanirah. 

1395
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:03,860
 Ya Şafi! 

1396
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:08,280
 She loses a lot of blood. 

1397
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,440
 Day... 

1398
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:13,800
 Open the victim, open your eyes. 

1399
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:17,620
 Don't worry, it's here, Ayşe Hatun. 

1400
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,480
 Be less calm. 

1401
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:23,320
 Hang on, Gündüz, hang on, lion. 

1402
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:28,520
 God help you. 

1403
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:30,580
 Thank goodness he is with us. 

1404
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
 My Lord forgave him. 

1405
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,080
 Bhabhi will pass, right? 

1406
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:41,240
 The only cure for such wounds ... 

1407
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:43,120
 It is to pray. 

1408
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,020
 Pray. 

1409
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:49,960
 Aygül must brand the wound. 

1410
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,040
 Who is the enemy ... 

1411
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,900
 His face will soon be obvious. 

1412
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:02,440
 Until then, nobody will be alone. 

1413
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:04,780
 May you increase the Batur guards. 

1414
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:06,700
 Tighten the night fits. 

1415
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:08,960
 Cenk is at the door. 

1416
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:11,020
 We must be vigilant. 

1417
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:13,700
 Upon my donation, my dear father. 

1418
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:15,500
 Come on, Alps. 

1419
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,220
 Is there anyone around witnessing the event ... 

1420
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:24,700
 Have an investigation. 

1421
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:26,040
 I call it a castle, dad. 

1422
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:28,020
 Such a good ambush ... 

1423
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:29,720
 However, it makes shroud. 

1424
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:33,360
 If it were a fortress, they would not survive anyone. 

1425
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:37,060
 Everybody wants to give an eyeball. 

1426
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:39,700
 The arrows thrown are not for my brother ... 

1427
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:43,840
 Bey is in the middle of the room. 

1428
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:49,820
 If it's not a castle ... 

1429
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:53,160
 There is only one Alşar who will dare to do this. 

1430
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,020
 Why would Alişar do such a thing, father? 

1431
02:14:57,020 --> 02:14:58,500
 I don't know why ... 

1432
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:01,060
 But he will dare to ... 

1433
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,400
 Who remains? 

1434
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:07,240
 Osman my cousin ... 

1435
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,700
 You know ... 

1436
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:11,560
 If there's anything you hear ... 

1437
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:13,460
 Tell me. 

1438
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,720
 I wonder like you are sure. 

1439
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:18,060
 I'll give you a trace. 

1440
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:24,120
 Come on then come on. 

1441
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:30,740
 Brothers, let's be thesis. 

1442
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:32,680
 Osman Bey will be out soon. 

1443
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,320
 We will go trail. 

1444
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,620
 Stop, bro. 

1445
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,680
 We don't know what happened. 

1446
02:15:38,420 --> 02:15:40,420
 Don't you know my Orhan Osman? 

1447
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,400
 He'll be out of this door in a moment, he says, we're going to trace. 

1448
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:48,020
 The fire that hits all the world in his heart is hidden. 

1449
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,200
 Thank you bro. 

1450
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:51,860
 This is the word that makes this crap ... 

1451
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:53,880
 If we don't act this land hell ... 

1452
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:55,840
 Neither our name nor our judgment remains. 

1453
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,040
 What is the situation of my Osman Bey Gündüz Bey? 

1454
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:08,920
 He will be healed with the permission of Allah. 

1455
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:10,940
 God willing. 

1456
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:15,300
 Let us decipher the mountains. 

1457
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:20,540
 Alişar understood what we did. 

1458
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:22,500
 He wants to pay the price. 

1459
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:25,560
 He will see our might. 

1460
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:29,420
 How we will make this homeland be a hell to beloved servants ... 

1461
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,160
 Who does Osman do this? 

1462
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:36,160
 Who tries to chop my day? 

1463
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,400
 Alişar iti! 

1464
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:44,420
 So now to sword and fight .... 

1465
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:46,560
 It is time to hit the trail. 

1466
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:49,880
 How long have I been rotten? 

1467
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:52,700
 For some time I would see gas in my dreams ... 

1468
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,500
 Thank God, 

1469
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:57,220
 We're going to ambush. 

1470
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,680
 Who was the clerk of the war profession ... 

1471
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:01,800
 We'll show. 

1472
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:03,280
 Come on then, Osman. 

1473
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:04,360
 Come on lions to horses 

1474
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:05,100
 Mr. Bamsı. 

1475
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:07,700
 You stay in that place. 

1476
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:10,940
 We need ears to see and hear. 

1477
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:14,580
 You know my place. 

1478
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:18,120
 Thank you, Osman. 

1479
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:19,400
 You're right. 

1480
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:22,100
 I also know my place. 

1481
02:17:26,480 --> 02:17:29,020
 Come on heroes come on lions ...

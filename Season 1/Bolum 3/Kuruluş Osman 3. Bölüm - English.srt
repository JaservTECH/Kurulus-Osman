1
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,920
 Look at the ordeal we have to keep him alive. 

2
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,560
 Oh cruel world, ah! 

3
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,980
 I knead the steel and knead it, Batur Bey. 

4
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,040
 If the whole world comes together ... 

5
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,440
 ... no one can wear his wrist unofficially. 

6
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,100
 If Cenkte puts me half way ... 

7
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,500
 ... then no one can take you away, blacksmith. 

8
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,775
 Which trouble did you get in again? 

9
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,600
 It was all a lie. 

10
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,280
 Kalanoz! 

11
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
 Listen to me. 

12
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
 Damn you. 

13
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
 Stop! 

14
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:32,885
 Who are you? 

15
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:25,055
 The one that will put Byzantine back on its feet ... 

16
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,545
 ... we are the only power. 

17
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,145
 Commander Kalanoz. 

18
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,260
 It is big... 

19
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,180
 ... of that sacred power ... 

20
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:39,075
 ... we are the only owners. 

21
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,465
 Fighting against the Turks ... 

22
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:46,845
 ... to restore our empire to its former power ... 

23
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,140
 ... to protect Hagia Sophia in Constantinople ... 

24
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,060
 ... we swore to death. 

25
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,155
 Who are you? 

26
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,475
 Yannis. 

27
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,015
 The monk Yannis. 

28
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,585
 The Margarite Church in Serres ... 

29
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,955
 I'm a loyal servant. 

30
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,900
 Everyone you see here ... 

31
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:11,700
 ... on behalf of our church ... 

32
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:14,625
 ... are the guards of Kulucahisar. 

33
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,120
 Kulucahisar is just one of the castles under our control. 

34
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,015
 With many more castle commanders ... 

35
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:35,315
 ... with their soldiers and even their tekfur ... 

36
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:36,505
 ... is in our disposal. 

37
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:39,685
 Sofia. 

38
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:42,895
 What about you? 

39
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,875
 Growing with Turkish hatred ... 

40
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,460
 I am a woman who obeyed Master Yannis to the end. 

41
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,480
 To the man I fell in love with ... 

42
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:05,755
 ... a woman who has not been able to open it for years. 

43
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,375
 To a commander like you ... 

44
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,440
 ... joining us, adding strength to our strength ... 

45
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,940
 ... until the last drop of our blood with us ... 

46
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,780
 ... I propose to fight the Turks. 

47
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,300
 Commander Kalanoz. 

48
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
 Say it to me. 

49
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:49,165
 What was your wish in the castle? 

50
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
 Obviously you got something secret from there. 

51
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,140
 Or... 

52
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
 ... treasure? 

53
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,125
 You know, Osman. 

54
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,680
 Is the Treasury. But what did we steal that treasure? 

55
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,800
 neither did we extort. 

56
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:07,435
 With the help of Allah's grace and help ... 

57
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,855
 ... we took back what was ours. 

58
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,755
 All of the treasure ... 

59
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,980
 ... belong to the people. 

60
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,300
 I know the Ahis ... 

61
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,540
 ... their resistance to the Mongols ... 

62
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:22,145
 ... but my skin gets scarred Edabali. 

63
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:25,335
 Why do the people in the castle hostile you? 

64
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:27,385
 Why did they steal your treasure? 

65
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,175
 What happened at the castle? 

66
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,495
 Your daughter Bala ... 

67
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,595
 ... what was your lover Tursun there for? 

68
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,415
 A dark power that reigns in Bitinya ... 

69
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,985
 ... infiltrated everywhere, every corner. 

70
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:44,845
 You take a look ... 

71
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:48,885
 ... they reign with their ideas, you take a look ... 

72
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,240
 ... with their men. 

73
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,320
 What do they want? 

74
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
 What are their Murat's? 

75
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,705
 In the darkness they put on us ... 

76
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,200
 ... they want to strangle the order in us, son. 

77
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,940
 They expel the Turks from this land ... 

78
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:09,985
 ... they want to revive the Byzantine spirit. 

79
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:14,735
 They know that the Ahis will not bow. 

80
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,780
 To be a bent in front of us ... 

81
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,980
 They stole the treasure, which was the capital of the Ahis. 

82
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:23,905
 Us... 

83
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,255
 ... they want to drag economic crisis, son. 

84
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,900
 Even Sofia, who killed Tekfur and took over Kulucahisar Castle ... 

85
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,000
 ... their representative in the castle. 

86
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
 Those who stole this treasure from you ... 

87
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,300
 ... as you described ... 

88
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,420
 Edabali, a dark and great power. 

89
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,140
 The power behind those who lean back on Hakk ... 

90
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:55,225
 ... always bigger son. 

91
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,255
 What anxiety we have, 

92
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,160
 nor our fear. Because we know and believe that ... 

93
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,180
 ... even though the swearing armies are shattered ... 

94
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,340
 ... where all truth takes refuge ... 

95
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,280
 There is a Hira Cave. 

96
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:17,945
 What you told me warmed my heart. 

97
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,565
 It is born inside me that ... 

98
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,640
 ... in so many galleries ... 

99
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,480
 ... we need ... 

100
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,080
 ... is a strong union. 

101
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,520
 No mob will shake ... 

102
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,895
 ... kaviar ... 

103
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,115
 ... an imposing principality. 

104
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,185
 Maybe... 

105
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,265
 maybe a state. 

106
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,185
 It... 

107
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:45,305
 ... there must be such a state that ... 

108
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:49,005
 justice must be resurrected with it. 

109
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,020
 Islam should find peace ... 

110
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,500
 ... the oppressors should tremble with fear ... 

111
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:57,785
 ...morality... 

112
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,540
 ... he must stand up with him. 

113
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,080
 Surprise Commander Kalanoz. 

114
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,380
 Just answer. 

115
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,385
 Are you with us 

116
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,105
 Let's say I am not. 

117
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,800
 Are you going to kill me too? 

118
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,660
 Any commander who is Greek and has no Turkish hatred ... 

119
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,420
 ... has no right to live, Kalanoz. 

120
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:44,295
 We set out for a big case. 

121
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,080
 And our enemies are so close ... 

122
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,660
 ... our ideals are dubbed in our heart ... 

123
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,145
 ... there is no room for mercy. 

124
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,260
 Who are these enemies? 

125
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,440
 Sheikh Edabali. 

126
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,080
 And his priests. 

127
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:01,315
 An old sheikh and a handful of ahms. 

128
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,640
 Why made you so nervous, Monk Yannis? 

129
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,180
 You don't know them, Kalanoz. 

130
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,715
 Sheikh Edabali ... 

131
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,765
 ... is the Turks' undeliverable spirit. 

132
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:21,195
 Even the Mongols could not cope with the ahis. 

133
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:25,045
 So much so that when we say it's over ... 

134
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,975
 they start again. 

135
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,940
 So how do you deal with it? 

136
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,980
 For the sake of ideals like you ... 

137
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,860
 ... with heroes who will die. 

138
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,520
 We Greeks have an ancient saying. 

139
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:43,645
 Wolf hunting ... 

140
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,325
 ... you should know your ax. 

141
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:50,605
 If we don't know our axes ... 

142
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,575
 ... we cannot keep Turks in front. 

143
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,660
 And if we can not keep Sheikh Edabali and his philanthropists ... 

144
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,675
 ... with the veterans, the alps ... 

145
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:04,005
 ... and it is in alliance with the abyss ... 

146
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,465
 ... this will be our apocalypse. 

147
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,215
 Now... 

148
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:13,425
 ... I ask my question from the beginning, Commander Kalanoz. 

149
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,580
 Years later, do you want to be called a traitor? 

150
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,880
 Otherwise, stopping the influx of the Turks ... 

151
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,260
 as a hero? 

152
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,335
 On this holy road ... 

153
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:49,495
 I'm with you to death. 

154
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,920
 Shut up! 

155
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,280
 Shut up. 

156
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:16,885
 Now Osman Bey would not need you ... 

157
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,825
 ... I was going to swim alive. 

158
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,480
 I told you everything I know. 

159
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,640
 Let me go! 

160
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,820
 Ornamental! Ornamental! Ornamental! 

161
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,580
 Hungry! Hungry! 

162
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,860
 Hungry! 

163
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,180
 Now sit well behaved here. 

164
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:27,685
 One question. 

165
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:28,985
 One answer. 

166
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:31,585
 Who are you? 

167
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,480
 Selamun aleykum. 

168
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,340
 Yarenler. 

169
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,160
 Selamun aleykum. 

170
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,380
 Hello, hello. 

171
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,935
 You can distinguish the warp two-folded ones and the wefts with a single twist well. 

172
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,940
 Weavings with kufi motifs and those with oak motifs are still raw. 

173
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,955
 Selling them in the market in this way does not suit us. 

174
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,300
 Bala Hatun on her head. 

175
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,380
 Bala Hatun on her head. 

176
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,480
 The skin of casual and fraud is not suitable for the market. 

177
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,020
 Draw the strange guraba and distribute it to his reward. 

178
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,580
 Aye. 

179
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,680
 Bala Hatun on her head. 

180
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,360
 Not just pusat shaking. 

181
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,745
 You are skilled in trade, Bala Hatun. 

182
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,335
 Pusatla our dear, Turkish fortune in trade ... 

183
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,725
 We protect our ceremony with Osman, Osman. 

184
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,440
 Turkish ceremony ... 

185
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,740
 ... first of all, he said on the shoulders of the girls, my dear. 

186
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,660
 Thanks to you, I saw how right he was. 

187
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,760
 Bala Hatun. 

188
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,160
 Take the Horse ... 

189
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,540
 What happened to Alaca? 

190
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,360
 Ahvali is not good. 

191
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:01,955
 In the barn. 

192
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:40,845
 Where it passes, weed, my dear friend. 

193
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:44,795
 The wing of Bala Hatun is Alaca. 

194
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:50,055
 Did I have a destiny to see you like this? 

195
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,635
 Osman Bey jumped out of the epic Manas and entered my life. 

196
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,385
 Kanıkeydin Taytoru was for me. 

197
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:18,465
 What an ornament in the sky ... 

198
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:22,185
 I would have been crescent with light on dark roads. 

199
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:30,605
 Spruce... 

200
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,820
 ... let me excuse you, Bala Hatun. 

201
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,960
 Does the moon get angry because the black cloud collapses in front of the moon in the sky? 

202
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:00,260
 Pied. 

203
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,420
 You missed a lot of troubles with Bala Hatun ... 

204
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,300
 ... it is obvious from the wounds you entered in many wars. 

205
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,745
 You are brave as you own. 

206
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,460
 Your eye is black. 

207
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,260
 You will not give up, you will not surrender. 

208
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:09,015
 Bala Hatun is certain that you gave your horse the right. 

209
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,715
 You like your friend, you ride like your enemy. 

210
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,665
 He has suffered so much ... 

211
00:25:14,665 --> 00:25:16,295
 ... thrown the pain ... 

212
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,945
 ... despite the inflammation in his blood, he did not speak. 

213
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:24,415
 For you... 

214
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:33,445
 If you have faith ... 

215
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,065
 ... as you saved me from mud ... 

216
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,560
 ... let me do well. 

217
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,140
 I didn't trust you ... 

218
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,715
 ... I brought it to my father's slope, Osman Bey. 

219
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:50,505
 My horse is entrusted to you. 

220
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:00,385
 Pied ... 

221
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:02,835
 Pied ... 

222
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:15,865
 Inflammation in your blood will be good. 

223
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:18,815
 Now... 

224
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:23,405
 I say, let's take you and go to the place. 

225
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,325
 I'll treat it there. 

226
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,365
 Let me ... 

227
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:31,165
 ... from the beautiful eyes of the owner, Bala Hatun ... 

228
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,525
 ... let's not shed once again. 

229
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,080
 May Allah give you whatever you want Osman Bey. 

230
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
 My only wish ... 

231
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,560
 ... come to the new market tomorrow and let me see you again. 

232
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:07,365
 My non-comrade is entrusted to you. 

233
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:10,575
 Excuse me, Osman Bey. 

234
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:13,905
 If I have two hands in the blood ... 

235
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,355
 ... I will bring pied. 

236
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:33,145
 When you say be ... 

237
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,440
 ... of Allah Almighty, who filled our hearts with the light of faith ... 

238
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,540
 ... by the name of ninety-nine. 

239
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:48,895
 Pusat equipped and ... 

240
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:52,195
 ... to cut their sentences ... 

241
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,365
 ... everyone waits for orders. 

242
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,940
 However, Dundar Bey you are like distractions. 

243
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,040
 Your pain ... 

244
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,895
 ... I understand your anger too, Bamsı Bey. 

245
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,820
 But without knowing the original work ... 

246
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,240
 ... is it wise to want a war? 

247
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,625
 Mr. Dundar. 

248
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,440
 What you call Cenk was just the needy thing, many little people could not overthrow many. 

249
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,580
 The lack of our assembly ... 

250
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:35,405
 ... heart is Dundar Bey. 

251
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,355
 The lack is heart. 

252
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:44,275
 My father... 

253
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:47,355
 ... Dundar Bey ... 

254
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:49,935
 ... his heart ... 

255
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:53,485
 ... put his head on the road of our Ertuğrul Bey. 

256
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,735
 Starting this way ... 

257
00:28:58,265 --> 00:29:00,425
 ... just as a child ... 

258
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:03,325
 ... has proved its fatality. 

259
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:06,715
 Now... 

260
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,220
 ... no one should try to question my father's courage. 

261
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,760
 We said let's trade. 

262
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:29,895
 They attempted to assassinate. 

263
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:35,385
 Our Aybars were martyred. 

264
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,960
 My brother Osman, on the other hand, stays in an unknown well. 

265
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,800
 Cenk is our profession. 

266
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:49,005
 Not that... 

267
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,195
 patience is also our guide. 

268
00:29:57,825 --> 00:30:00,035
 Until I get news from Osman ... 

269
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,820
 ... I will not act. 

270
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,420
 Thank God. 

271
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
 Osman Bey is coming! Osman Bey is coming! 

272
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,940
 Thank God! 

273
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,920
 Well, sir! Welcome sir! 

274
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,180
 Take it to the barn. 

275
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,840
 Neither brother, we leave Osman to the shroud. 

276
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:49,855
 Nor... 

277
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,625
 ... now we can afford cen 

278
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:54,645
 My nephew is right. 

279
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,455
 To say Cenk ... 

280
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,285
 ...time... 

281
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:01,525
 ... is very early. 

282
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,865
 Until Osman returns ... 

283
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:06,745
 ... it is good to stay vigilant. 

284
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,980
 Oy Osman. 

285
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,820
 While the rooster is in love ... 

286
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,740
 Dundar Bey is the pass of the vigilant brave. 

287
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,065
 Cenk? 

288
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,685
 Peace? 

289
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,945
 You should also listen to me. 

290
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:45,405
 Here you go. 

291
00:32:58,515 --> 00:32:59,665
 I promise ... 

292
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,245
 ... brave gentlemen here. 

293
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,365
 With fitna radiating from Kulucahisar ... 

294
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:08,395
 ... it's time to fight. 

295
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,445
 Not that... 

296
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:13,345
 ... combat with a simple sword ... 

297
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:16,745
 ... will enliven the life of the sinister enemy. 

298
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:22,975
 What do you mean, Osman? 

299
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:24,875
 Cuts in ... 

300
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:28,005
 ... as you cut pieces of flesh ... 

301
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,085
 ... with stronger limbs than before ... 

302
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:32,565
 ... will strangle us ... 

303
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:35,025
 ... we have a tough enemy. 

304
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,740
 The coffins behind the walls ... 

305
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,480
 ... it's time to cut his heart with a dagger. 

306
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,660
 It is imperative that the gentlemen here make a war decision today. 

307
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
 Not that... 

308
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,005
 ... the decision of this ... 

309
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:00,715
 ... Dundar Bey will give. 

310
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:09,965
 Joyful... 

311
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,800
 ... how did you grow and mature like plum plum bro? 

312
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,200
 In this land ... 

313
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,900
 ... there is no room for both rawness and brotherhood. 

314
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,360
 The biggest toy is to go blindly to the well of the shroud with the rope of trade. 

315
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,620
 Today from this toy ... 

316
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,775
 ... a warrant must be issued for the recruitment of Turk. 

317
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,525
 Otherwise... 

318
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,680
 ... you dig your grave, you know. 

319
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:08,015
 He killed his own tekfur and ... 

320
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,580
 ... we are faced with traps against us with all kinds of tricks. 

321
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,400
 This cen ... 

322
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,820
 ... they started by killing my brother Aybars. 

323
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,365
 We... 

324
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:24,105
 ... we will stand up for the gas. 

325
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:27,135
 Now... 

326
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:28,455
 ... not war ... 

327
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,355
 ... is the time of martyrdom. 

328
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:39,465
 This is what I will say. 

329
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,200
 Kayı gentlemen's hand ... 

330
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,680
 ... for cenk ... 

331
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:47,215
 ... he must get up for gas. 

332
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,360
 It's time to kick off for the gas! 

333
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,240
 Osman Bey says right. 

334
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:03,635
 He won't be comfortable with the shroud. 

335
00:36:05,195 --> 00:36:08,555
 Thank you Osman Bey, time is time to fight. 

336
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,915
 Say it now. 

337
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:13,755
 Cenk? 

338
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:16,685
 Peace? 

339
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,660
 Cenkse cenk. The trust of our Ertuğrul Bey ... 

340
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,640
 ... than to give our Osman to the voyage ... 

341
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,460
 ... giving our lives is a must. 

342
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:46,955
 I see ... 

343
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:50,825
 ... gentlemen have made up their mind. 

344
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:52,920
 Not that... 

345
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:54,645
 ... this decision ... 

346
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,055
 ... exceeds my height. 

347
00:36:58,025 --> 00:36:59,925
 Until Ertuğrul Bey returns ... 

348
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,140
 ... we need to know patience. 

349
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,120
 Cenk decision ... 

350
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,020
 ... ceremonies are brains. 

351
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:12,615
 Now... 

352
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,265
 ... let me. 

353
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,465
 I would like to talk to my nephews. 

354
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,920
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

355
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,020
 [Ya Allah ...] 

356
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,500
 You are my daughter. 

357
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,260
 Thanks to ... 

358
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,040
 ... the trust of Pir-i Turkistan Ahmet Yesevi ... 

359
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,260
 ... this wooden sword is in our hands now. 

360
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,380
 I hope you pray with your prayer, father. 

361
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,740
 The most acceptable patronage is the effort of one's son ... 

362
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,280
 ... the most sincere prayer ... 

363
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,465
 ... verb daughter. 

364
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:05,425
 You did a real job. 

365
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:10,475
 Because this is a wooden sword. 

366
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:14,705
 Entering into the shouts with their steel lures ... 

367
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
 ... is not like black pusat. 

368
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,880
 This sword ... 

369
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,620
 ... occurs in the most depressed times. 

370
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:24,065
 And it reaches the new hakan of the Turks. 

371
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,000
 When he decorated the back of the Turks' new hakan with the grace of the folly ... 

372
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,240
 ... to destroy the swearing towns ... 

373
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:34,965
 ... will enter into hearts. 

374
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:42,105
 With the spiritual shit he spreads from here ... 

375
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,265
 ... cruel fear ... 

376
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:46,785
 will give hope to the oppressed. 

377
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,340
 In so much effort ... 

378
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,240
 ... how do we find that right, dad? 

379
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:58,075
 Does it have a wisdom or secret? 

380
00:40:58,315 --> 00:40:59,575
 We'll find it, girl. 

381
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:03,065
 Despite all the zemheri ... 

382
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,520
 ... managed not to go out ... 

383
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,340
 ... we'll find that spark. 

384
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,420
 Because this wooden sword ... 

385
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,960
 ... when we put that spark on his waist ... 

386
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:17,745
 ... that spark ... 

387
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:20,045
 ... turning into a volcano ... 

388
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:22,905
 ... donut on the oppressed ... 

389
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,675
 ... will burn the veil of captivity and possession. 

390
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,300
 Who is this hakan? 

391
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,480
 In the fight of truth and superstition, who does not resist shaking pusat ... 

392
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,380
 ... not only with his heart ... 

393
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,220
 ... who can work with his mind and rest his back on the oppressed ... 

394
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,900
 ... one person. 

395
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,240
 Er son ... 

396
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
 ... is a person! 

397
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:02,555
 When Ahval is like this ... 

398
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:04,305
 ... I say ... 

399
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,935
 ... let's put Kulucahisar Castle in the Islamic town. 

400
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,605
 If we are victorious ... 

401
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:16,625
 ... we drop all the castles. 

402
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,455
 Thus, from Mongolian tasallut ... 

403
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:23,945
 ... we will be saved from the Byzantine assault. 

404
00:42:25,305 --> 00:42:26,595
 Islamic banner ... 

405
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,335
 ... we wave everywhere. 

406
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,485
 Stop, nephew ... 

407
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,160
 ...Stop. 

408
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:35,215
 What is this paper clip? 

409
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,680
 Even you will stay on the murder ... 

410
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,060
 ... did you stay in that castle? 

411
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:46,555
 I'm left sure. 

412
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:50,485
 Because the killer of tekfur ... 

413
00:42:50,515 --> 00:42:52,445
 ... my brother is the killer of Aybars. 

414
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:55,685
 Osman. 

415
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:02,015
 There is nothing you hide from us, brother? 

416
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,060
 What else will I keep on all this information, brother? 

417
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,740
 We give on ... 

418
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,700
 ... all labor ... 

419
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,100
 Halal to you, Osman. 

420
00:43:20,405 --> 00:43:22,235
 In the pusat you carry ... 

421
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:26,275
 ... you also gave the right to be the son of a gentleman. 

422
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:29,685
 I am proud of you as Emmin. 

423
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:37,455
 Did he suck in spite of kidnapping Aygül? 

424
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:42,425
 My nephew, my nephew at the enemy. 

425
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,440
 You do not have a genius in what happened to my daughter. 

426
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:49,505
 Thank you. 

427
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
 Into the fitna in the castle ... 

428
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,440
 ... you plunged like a blind dagger. 

429
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,480
 In every misfortune that has happened ... 

430
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,000
 ... they marked you. 

431
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,020
 That is what I mean ... 

432
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,880
 ... Ertuğrul Bey, beware of himself until he returns. 

433
00:44:18,935 --> 00:44:20,625
 I trust you, Osman. 

434
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:22,595
 To yourself ... 

435
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:24,055
 ... to your alps ... 

436
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:25,715
 ... be the judge. 

437
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:28,145
 Don't worry, sure. 

438
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:33,955
 Unless there is a crap from the castle ... 

439
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,235
 ... to myself ... 

440
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:38,825
 ... I will be compared to my alps. 

441
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:53,985
 God... 

442
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,185
 ... help us. 

443
00:45:19,445 --> 00:45:21,205
 I want your permission too. 

444
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:40,325
 And what they hide from me ... 

445
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:43,155
 ... how he got into trouble ... 

446
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:45,385
 ... I will learn Osman. 

447
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,905
 At that time... 

448
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,615
 ...I will talk to you. 

449
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,265
 We will comment. 

450
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:09,965
 Master Yannis, the light on your face ... 

451
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:14,125
 ... he tells me that the incoming information is important. 

452
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:18,005
 Our man in the market, Nizamettin. 

453
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:22,235
 He wrote that the Ahis were in the new market. 

454
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,040
 Osman was also with them. 

455
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,740
 As I guessed. 

456
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,635
 Osman is with them. 

457
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,375
 It is obvious that the Ahis are organized in the new market. 

458
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,380
 We need to prevent this. 

459
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,760
 We will be Kalanoz, we will. 

460
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,380
 Destroying the market and ... 

461
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,460
 ... we will kill them all. 

462
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:47,325
 If I attack my soldiers, this will be the cause of war, but ... 

463
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,980
 I'm ready for war. 

464
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,720
 It's early for war yet. 

465
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,020
 And this is not your job ... 

466
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,840
 ... others will. 

467
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:59,315
 Who can do this other than me, Master Yannis? 

468
00:47:38,615 --> 00:47:41,085
 The bloody sword of Catalonia ... 

469
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,040
 Prince Salvador. 

470
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,460
 I am at your disposal with my fearless warriors, Master Yannis. 

471
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,240
 Pied! 

472
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,960
 That's it. 

473
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,980
 Emmim grabs my back. 

474
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,095
 Honey drips from your tongue. 

475
00:48:36,995 --> 00:48:38,775
 Not a good sign, huh? 

476
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:41,685
 Not a good sign. 

477
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:47,815
 But my absorption is smart man. 

478
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,455
 First I keep my heart nice ... 

479
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:55,835
 ... is chasing what it will do. 

480
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,600
 Hullo. 

481
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,020
 Do not worry, you will recover in time. 

482
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:16,495
 Come on, let's. 

483
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:20,575
 Come on, let's. 

484
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:27,825
 Mr. Osman. 

485
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:31,305
 I was going to lose my mind while I was waiting for you. 

486
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:37,945
 Are you angry with me? 

487
00:49:40,295 --> 00:49:42,565
 There is nothing left for me. 

488
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,565
 It is counted if I live. 

489
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,165
 May Allah be pleased with you. 

490
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:52,305
 You are in my blood, you are in my life Aygül Hatun. 

491
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,140
 First of all, your life comes. 

492
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,320
 Who is this horse? 

493
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,960
 Poisoned. 

494
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,020
 From the grass he ate. 

495
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,740
 A cookie girl I met on the way. 

496
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:30,495
 I said that Ointment of Zühre is good for him. 

497
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,340
 I will take it tomorrow and take it to the new market. 

498
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,140
 I will give it to the owner. 

499
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,620
 Come easy Osman Bey. 

500
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,080
 Thank you. 

501
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:02,955
 Horse... 

502
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:05,525
 ...one... 

503
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,900
 ... the Chechhar daughter. 

504
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,440
 The Chechen girl, huh? 

505
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,620
 Open your eyes, Aygül. One sooner ... 

506
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,160
 ... if he carries the name of a chick to the oba ... 

507
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,635
 ... know that fire fell into your heart. 

508
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,540
 Pied. 

509
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,180
 Come. 

510
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:29,215
 Lets. 

511
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:30,585
 Come on beauty. 

512
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:55,435
 Welcome, Gonca Hatun. 

513
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:13,885
 If you were a breath, Bala Hatun. 

514
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:15,995
 We've gotten through all that bad. 

515
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,140
 You don't know how I miss sitting on my job, Gonca Hatun. 

516
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,740
 Who are they, Bala Hatun? 

517
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:46,755
 Two lovers. 

518
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:50,685
 Aslı and Kerem. 

519
00:52:57,705 --> 00:52:59,365
 Since the lovers ... 

520
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:02,005
 ... why do they stand apart? 

521
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,195
 I heard his stories from a Aleppo traveler. 

522
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:15,025
 Without coming to Vuslata ... 

523
00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:17,905
 ... It became ash with the longing of Kerem Aslı. 

524
00:53:21,055 --> 00:53:24,395
 Aslı also brushed her hair and swept these ashes. 

525
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:29,585
 You will understand that the figures are apocalyptic ... 

526
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:31,965
 ... their stories are up to us. 

527
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:38,915
 What should I say, Bala? 

528
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,175
 May God grant love. 

529
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:43,555
 Amine. 

530
00:53:54,085 --> 00:53:55,935
 When Osman Bey arrives ... 

531
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,280
 I hope he will not be subjected to the suckling of his suckling. 

532
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,280
 Osman Bey evelallah, stuck like a dagger in the heart of the shroud. 

533
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,260
 You don't worry. 

534
00:54:05,735 --> 00:54:07,905
 They will also overcome them. 

535
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,245
 Both ... 

536
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:13,325
 ... my sheikh opened his heart to him. 

537
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,335
 If he did not see the ore that would carry our secret ... 

538
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:19,505
 ... would he open his heart Gonca Hatun? 

539
00:55:00,785 --> 00:55:02,835
 Teokles still has not arrived, sir. 

540
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:06,315
 What if Teokles fell into Osman's hands? 

541
00:55:09,115 --> 00:55:10,605
 Damn it! 

542
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,000
 If it makes him talk, things get mixed up. 

543
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,240
 It would be impossible for us to find the treasure. 

544
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,540
 Commander Andreas! 

545
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,700
 Command, sir. 

546
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,480
 I sent Teokles after Osman, he still hasn't returned. 

547
00:55:38,765 --> 00:55:41,485
 Find him, Andreas. 

548
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:46,185
 Whatever happens. 

549
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:48,215
 Find it! 

550
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,725
 They hide what they know from us. 

551
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,980
 [Is there a destur?] 

552
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,760
 Come on, Samsa! 

553
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,360
 We see your face from hunting to hunting. 

554
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:35,325
 What did you do well, Samsa. 

555
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,355
 We left you alone in that castle, we went. 

556
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:39,355
 But... 

557
00:56:39,655 --> 00:56:42,825
 ... you got out of the snake's well with your claws, ma'am. 

558
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:45,725
 We are the hereafter brothers with you, Samsa. 

559
00:56:45,855 --> 00:56:47,725
 He was amazed at this time. 

560
00:56:48,915 --> 00:56:50,055
 Here Basin. 

561
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:54,425
 What do you call this Teokles, to the voucher, 

562
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:57,285
 ... will ignite well when he doesn't return to the castle. 

563
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,780
 Who is Teokles? 

564
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,960
 It's the one they sent Ecel. 

565
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,080
 Now we have it. 

566
00:57:04,705 --> 00:57:06,715
 I know, I know Osman. 

567
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:10,175
 I know my Aybars won't put their blood on the ground. 

568
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,760
 Teokles will take us to my Aybars brother's murderers. 

569
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,960
 Thank you son. 

570
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:19,625
 Thank you. 

571
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:24,275
 What was chopping the beech's stout? 

572
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:26,135
 Then they will see. 

573
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,700
 For the sign of worship ... 

574
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,235
 ... if I do not peel their skin in pieces and stick to salt ... 

575
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:35,635
 ... they should not tell me the son of Ertuğrul Gazi, Osman. 

576
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,140
 [Is there a destur, sir?] 

577
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,520
 Come on, Boranalp. 

578
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,280
 No Boran? 

579
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:51,435
 What is this face? 

580
00:57:52,975 --> 00:57:53,995
 Osman Bey ... 

581
00:57:58,265 --> 00:57:59,775
 Teokles fled, sir. 

582
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:01,535
 How did he escape? 

583
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:06,855
 Didn't I entrust him to you, Boran? 

584
00:58:08,755 --> 00:58:09,755
 Answer me! 

585
00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:13,945
 How could you not protect a man with his hands tied? 

586
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:15,565
 How not? 

587
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,520
 Weren't you at the beginning? 

588
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,340
 I did your treatment as you said. 

589
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,000
 Then I went to the woods hunting so that he would not die of pain. 

590
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,120
 When I returned, it was not there. 

591
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,460
 They cut the rope with a dagger, sir. 

592
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,640
 Someone has missed him. 

593
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,460
 Who did this? 

594
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,260
 Who? 

595
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,640
 [Is there any destur, Mr. Dundar?] 

596
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,540
 Come on, son. 

597
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,620
 You're coming. 

598
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,460
 I have something to tell you, my father. 

599
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,800
 Tell me, let's see. 

600
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,980
 Osman. 

601
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,885
 What did Osman do again? 

602
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,220
 He captured Teokles, one of the hunters of Sofia, right. 

603
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,380
 Where is it? 

604
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:09,395
 Don't worry, my father. 

605
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,380
 I took him out of Osman's lair. 

606
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,580
 A knowledge ... 

607
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,140
 Did you get it? 

608
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:18,105
 When Osman escaped from the castle, he followed him to catch up. 

609
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:19,535
 Who? 

610
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:20,685
 Sofia. 

611
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:22,705
 Sofia. 

612
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,355
 Osman mistook Teokles. 

613
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:38,245
 But now it is good. 

614
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:40,765
 To that point ... 

615
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,340
 Where is it now? 

616
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,840
 We have the informal father. 

617
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,880
 This knowledge will save Bitinya from a great war. 

618
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,380
 Joyful... 

619
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:56,515
 ... News to Gündüz Bey. 

620
00:59:56,855 --> 00:59:57,855
 Lets. 

621
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:19,045
 Coyote to the nook ... 

622
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:21,795
 ... to the bear's lair. 

623
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,395
 His destination is clear. 

624
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:28,825
 Castle. 

625
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,860
 I will hit the jackal nook. 

626
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,960
 I will drown the bear in his lair. 

627
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:38,815
 I Usman. 

628
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,480
 The scraps of this shroud do not cease. 

629
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,640
 They may have played to attract you to the castle. 

630
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:49,675
 We should act as the tomb of Teokles, Bamsı Bey. 

631
01:00:49,675 --> 01:00:50,745
 We must act ... 

632
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,520
 No one should ever try to take a man from Osman Bey. 

633
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,700
 Let the punishment we punish be legendary. 

634
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:03,625
 Samsa Sergeant. 

635
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,735
 Hunting time in the castle. 

636
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:11,255
 Creature in the forest has recognized me well. 

637
01:01:12,155 --> 01:01:14,115
 For some time they had been in a dead end. 

638
01:01:15,945 --> 01:01:17,855
 I hope the castle will be fertile. 

639
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:21,185
 I would have stooped. You did it 

640
01:01:21,455 --> 01:01:22,465
 I'm shaad. 

641
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,420
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

642
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,700
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

643
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,420
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

644
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,660
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

645
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,120
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

646
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,640
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

647
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,560
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

648
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,540
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

649
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,400
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

650
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,300
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

651
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,220
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

652
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,460
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

653
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,300
 On the holy road of God ... 

654
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,760
 ... the bond in your eyes is gone now, Kalanoz. 

655
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,600
 On the way to the Holy Margarite Church ... 

656
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:43,335
 ... to fight the Turks until his death ... 

657
01:02:43,335 --> 01:02:44,935
 ... do you swear? 

658
01:02:47,885 --> 01:02:48,885
 I would. 

659
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:53,855
 Whatever Turks know holy ... 

660
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,905
 ... that he was going to cover his chest in front of him ... 

661
01:02:56,905 --> 01:02:58,575
 ... do you swear? 

662
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,405
 I would. 

663
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,695
 God bless you. 

664
01:03:19,855 --> 01:03:22,275
 With all my soldiers printing the new market ... 

665
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:25,545
 I was ready to destroy the priests, Master Yannis. 

666
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,320
 I hope the Catalans can handle this job. 

667
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,340
 I have not even the slightest doubt of this, Kalanoz. 

668
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,495
 When the time comes you will do much more. 

669
01:03:34,495 --> 01:03:36,635
 But as you say ... 

670
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,295
 ... the castle should not be suspected. 

671
01:03:38,725 --> 01:03:40,035
 Obama to ... 

672
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,285
 ... willow, her pastures ... 

673
01:03:44,045 --> 01:03:47,455
 ... the days when we will turn everywhere into a blood lake ... 

674
01:03:48,835 --> 01:03:50,675
 ... close to Kalanoz. 

675
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:53,375
 But now without getting our hands dirty ... 

676
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,580
 ... to our feet ... 

677
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,480
 ... we will clean the ahis. 

678
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,120
 More importantly... 

679
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,640
 ... we'll get back the holy trust. 

680
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,035
 That wooden sword ... 

681
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,360
 ... by Edabali's hand to the owner ... 

682
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,020
 ... we wake up the sleeping giant. 

683
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,900
 Do you understand me? 

684
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,180
 I get it, sir. 

685
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,880
 Welcome, son. 

686
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:27,385
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

687
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,140
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

688
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,900
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

689
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,120
 Torero monopathy tu deu. 

690
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,960
 [What you told me warmed my edabali.] 

691
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,315
 It... 

692
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,475
 ... there must be such a state that ... 

693
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,225
 ... justice must be resurrected with it ... 

694
01:04:53,985 --> 01:04:56,275
 Islam must find peace ... 

695
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,620
 ... the oppressors should tremble with fear ... 

696
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,940
 ...morality... 

697
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,720
 ... he must stand up with him. 

698
01:06:37,805 --> 01:06:39,915
 Sadakallâhu'l-azim. 

699
01:06:45,105 --> 01:06:46,305
 My God ... 

700
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:49,865
 ... seeing everything ... 

701
01:06:50,895 --> 01:06:52,235
 ...omniscient... 

702
01:06:53,265 --> 01:06:55,215
 ... you are the one who created everything. 

703
01:06:56,485 --> 01:06:58,055
 There is no secret to you. 

704
01:07:00,365 --> 01:07:03,615
 Even the most unknown is obvious to you. 

705
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:07,215
 These crazy passions inside me ... 

706
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:11,925
 ... dreams that are narrow in this rough ... 

707
01:07:12,505 --> 01:07:14,905
 ... my horizons beyond these lands ... 

708
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,920
 ... you know my dreams that won't fit in these lands. 

709
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,380
 This love ... 

710
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:25,245
 ... this passion ... 

711
01:07:26,195 --> 01:07:28,615
 ... you who gave these dreams to my heart ... 

712
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,980
 ... your crew ... 

713
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,920
 ... You give. 

714
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,055
 Ya Rab ... 

715
01:07:42,445 --> 01:07:43,865
 ... I had a dream ... 

716
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:48,615
 ... make this dream come true. 

717
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,820
 Allow me to move my father's banner forward. 

718
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,260
 I was in the soil when I opened my eyes. 

719
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:03,565
 How can you see beyond the waters. 

720
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,680
 All of us haze ... 

721
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,260
 ...smoke... 

722
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,900
 ... surrounded by enemies. 

723
01:08:14,185 --> 01:08:16,815
 With the fire of İlay wordetullah ... 

724
01:08:19,035 --> 01:08:21,235
 ... to illuminate this darkness ... 

725
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,595
 ... whatever you eat 

726
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,405
 Amine. 

727
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,440
 Emmi. 

728
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,760
 Good lesson and good lesson ... 

729
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,020
 ... I look at the road pus ... 

730
01:08:51,345 --> 01:08:52,820
 ... I look at the water is cloudy. 

731
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:57,625
 How will we trust these voyages after all these galleries? 

732
01:08:58,645 --> 01:09:00,885
 They should not try to be cunning again. 

733
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:05,655
 There is no cunning of fox, but ... 

734
01:09:06,445 --> 01:09:07,525
 ... in the market ... 

735
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:10,705
 Gündüz Bey is full of his post. 

736
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:17,325
 Emmi. 

737
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:19,635
 I think of Osman. 

738
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,760
 When we heard that we delivered Teokles to the castle ... 

739
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,380
 ... will be very angry. 

740
01:09:24,735 --> 01:09:27,095
 We cannot predict what to do and what to do. 

741
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,360
 Mr. Gündüz. 

742
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,920
 What shall we do? 

743
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,880
 Should we fight with Kulucahisar so that Osman will be angry? 

744
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,480
 Emmi. 

745
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:46,625
 My father Ertuğrul Bey will be back soon. 

746
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:49,535
 The killing of Tekfur ... 

747
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,580
 ... who wants to know who is behind Aybars martyrdom. 

748
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,340
 While Osman was seen in the castle that night ... 

749
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:00,455
 ... let me not give the only proof we have. 

750
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:07,015
 Let's not surrender ... 

751
01:10:08,525 --> 01:10:09,865
 ... what shall we have, my nephew? 

752
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,820
 Do you think there are only traitors inside them? 

753
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:28,055
 What if they know that Teokles is in our hands? 

754
01:10:29,215 --> 01:10:31,385
 Osman being seen in that castle ... 

755
01:10:31,385 --> 01:10:33,515
 ... is not a reason for war for them? 

756
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,180
 Until my brother returns ... 

757
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,920
 Our trade agreement with Kulucahisar will continue. 

758
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:45,495
 He has been struggling for years ... 

759
01:10:45,835 --> 01:10:47,595
 ... the peace that he established ... 

760
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:50,035
 ... I can't break it because of Osman. 

761
01:10:53,585 --> 01:10:54,585
 Not that... 

762
01:10:55,155 --> 01:10:57,175
 ... nevertheless Osman does not know about it. 

763
01:11:00,785 --> 01:11:01,785
 Now... 

764
01:11:02,315 --> 01:11:04,265
 Where is it? 

765
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:07,905
 I tied it to a nook behind the dark stream. 

766
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,060
 Even the devil cannot find his place. 

767
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,320
 Let's go then. 

768
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,360
 Son. 

769
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,800
 Moon son. 

770
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,520
 Arbars son. 

771
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,100
 Valiant son. 

772
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,380
 Hmm the ... 

773
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,900
 ... if I see hungry ... 

774
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,525
 ... I feed. 

775
01:12:14,725 --> 01:12:15,875
 If I see naked ... 

776
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:17,875
 ... I've rigged. 

777
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:21,165
 Like the hill ... 

778
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:23,245
 ... I stacked meat. 

779
01:12:25,585 --> 01:12:26,845
 Blood is poured and ... 

780
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:29,615
 ... I cut the victim. 

781
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,200
 With wish ... 

782
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,540
 ... with prayer ... 

783
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,180
 ... a son found it hard. 

784
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,380
 I found you. 

785
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,240
 I found you. 

786
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,660
 I found you, son. 

787
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,160
 Esselamu alaikum and mercy. 

788
01:13:21,675 --> 01:13:24,225
 Esselamu alaikum and mercy. 

789
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,040
 It doesn't come off that fast. 

790
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,800
 I know you Tursun. 

791
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:08,295
 Who are you? 

792
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,300
 Osman Bey sent. 

793
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,700
 hayrolsun. 

794
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,560
 Why did you come to the castle? 

795
01:14:19,605 --> 01:14:21,475
 I'll call someone named Teokles. 

796
01:14:29,505 --> 01:14:31,285
 Let me tell you from the beginning. 

797
01:15:13,085 --> 01:15:14,795
 Osman Bey spoke fairly. 

798
01:15:15,535 --> 01:15:17,895
 Finally, the place to come is the castle. 

799
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,135
 Not that... 

800
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:24,300
 ... came from the night? I don't know him. 

801
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:27,820
 Stop. 

802
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,600
 Don't be bored right away. 

803
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,920
 We enter every hole of the castle, we find it, evelallah. 

804
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,700
 What are these sounds? 

805
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,380
 Mr. Dundar. 

806
01:16:06,905 --> 01:16:07,905
 Mr. Gündüz. 

807
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:16,305
 Teokles next to them. 

808
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:23,780
 It is now clear who has bought it. 

809
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,940
 Dervish father! 

810
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,615
 Dervish father. 

811
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:31,175
 You gave love. 

812
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,140
 We became Bahtiyar. 

813
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,580
 Astaghfurullah, astaghfurullah. 

814
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,660
 We actually saw you ... 

815
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,420
 ... we got love, comrade Nizamettin. 

816
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,280
 As soon as possible ... 

817
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,820
 ... we wish to establish a love ring with the lovers. 

818
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,020
 We opened the heart cafe. 

819
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,560
 The sentence went to news. 

820
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,180
 You can be informed too. 

821
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,300
 Our head is on our eyes, Derviş baba. 

822
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,160
 Where are they? 

823
01:18:10,215 --> 01:18:13,105
 Those who stand at the potter bench. 

824
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,720
 I was assassinated in your castle. 

825
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,660
 I thought it was not experienced. 

826
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:57,115
 You accused my nephew of murder ... 

827
01:18:58,175 --> 01:18:59,735
 ... I hit the cinema. 

828
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:08,425
 Burçin, the bride of Bamsı Bey, one of the lords of our obese ... 

829
01:19:09,195 --> 01:19:10,715
 ... you battered. 

830
01:19:11,655 --> 01:19:12,915
 I shut up. 

831
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:14,305
 My daughter ... 

832
01:19:15,145 --> 01:19:17,075
 ... you missed Aygül. 

833
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,180
 I closed my eyes. 

834
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,220
 After my nephew Osman ... 

835
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:26,185
 ... you released this killer. 

836
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,215
 I brought it back to you with my hands. 

837
01:19:31,025 --> 01:19:32,215
 Mr. Dundar. 

838
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,600
 We are very unhappy with these. 

839
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,920
 But remember that ... 

840
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,240
 ... my husband was killed. 

841
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,740
 Your home... 

842
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,360
 ... was my friend too. 

843
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:57,380
 The only suspect of your friend's death ... 

844
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,080
 ... your nephew is Osman. 

845
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:04,060
 He could not even stand trial and escaped from our pen. 

846
01:20:04,195 --> 01:20:06,715
 You too, to execute it ... 

847
01:20:07,295 --> 01:20:09,475
 ... you went after a pack of murderers. 

848
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,665
 Mr. Dundar. 

849
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:14,505
 If Osman is tried ... 

850
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,340
 ... and if he proves to be innocent, there will be no problem. 

851
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,560
 If only... 

852
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,720
 ... to show your good intentions ... 

853
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,940
 ... by relying on our justice ... 

854
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:28,615
 ... if you brought Osman rather than that. 

855
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:32,595
 I saw Osman last in this castle, Kalanoz. 

856
01:20:33,115 --> 01:20:36,135
 If he escapes from a fortress where you get his security ... 

857
01:20:36,985 --> 01:20:38,605
 ... I have nothing to do. 

858
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:44,065
 Osman... 

859
01:20:45,665 --> 01:20:46,985
 ... it will be prosecuted. 

860
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,800
 But he's not here. 

861
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,680
 Greeks too ... 

862
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,800
 ... there are also apricots ... 

863
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:56,485
 ... in a Willow court. 

864
01:21:14,075 --> 01:21:16,835
 I'm just chasing the truth, Mr. Dundar. 

865
01:21:24,075 --> 01:21:26,185
 Your offer has been accepted. 

866
01:21:30,505 --> 01:21:31,855
 So here you go ... 

867
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:33,305
 ... Dundar Bey. 

868
01:22:18,545 --> 01:22:21,075
 Get out of your room, Teokles. 

869
01:22:25,055 --> 01:22:26,655
 Get some rest. 

870
01:22:37,885 --> 01:22:38,885
 Door! 

871
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:09,725
 Storm... 

872
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,540
 ... you eat the horses. 

873
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,500
 Thank you sir. 

874
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,440
 Konuralp and you stay here. 

875
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,500
 Thank you sir. 

876
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,100
 Thief! 

877
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,220
 Thief! 

878
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,240
 Help! 

879
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,660
 He took my pouch! 

880
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:29,840
 Help! 

881
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,020
 The gold is gone! 

882
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,260
 Running! 

883
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:13,720
 Bey. 

884
01:25:14,845 --> 01:25:16,645
 Sir, forgive me, sir. 

885
01:25:21,535 --> 01:25:23,305
 Sir, forgive me, sir. 

886
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:30,515
 What will you be, sir? 

887
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,100
 Bey. 

888
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:40,425
 Nizamettin Bey! 

889
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,065
 I sentenced these two thieves. 

890
01:25:50,565 --> 01:25:52,505
 If I see them here again ... 

891
01:25:53,425 --> 01:25:55,535
 ... well know that they will die. 

892
01:26:02,565 --> 01:26:05,045
 They deserved that you fined. 

893
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,020
 May you exist, Osman Bey. 

894
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,320
 First of all, Nizamettin Bey should do your duty properly. 

895
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,980
 Remember your vow here that there will be no particle musk injustice. 

896
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,200
 If there is such an event again ... 

897
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,145
 ... I ask your account from you. 

898
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,700
 The language is long, the long hand, the long hand. 

899
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,320
 Osman Bey found what he deserved. 

900
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,460
 Take those thieves. 

901
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,360
 Are you looking for my mother? 

902
01:27:25,205 --> 01:27:28,375
 Thank you very much, god bless you. 

903
01:27:31,275 --> 01:27:33,215
 Aren't you Osman Bey? 

904
01:27:33,835 --> 01:27:35,685
 Ertuğrul Bey's son. 

905
01:27:36,635 --> 01:27:38,445
 You're brave like your father. 

906
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,180
 God loves you ... 

907
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,800
 May he forgive us in the just hands of gentlemen like you. 

908
01:27:46,235 --> 01:27:47,635
 Thank you very much. 

909
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,360
 God bless you. 

910
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,100
 Thank you, my dear. 

911
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:15,255
 Aslı and Kerem. 

912
01:28:18,895 --> 01:28:21,515
 I tried so hard, it is finally over. 

913
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,520
 Very nice thank you. 

914
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,980
 But the only thing that ends is not tiles ... 

915
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,420
 ... the treatment of his horse is over. 

916
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,280
 Yaman bahadır, son. 

917
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,860
 May your sword of justice be permanent. 

918
01:28:56,395 --> 01:28:57,845
 Thank you dervish father. 

919
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,880
 Where do you come from? Where do you go? 

920
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,540
 We came from Hay, we go to hu, son. 

921
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,560
 Navigation with our heart ... 

922
01:29:08,205 --> 01:29:10,795
 ... we travel with our feet. 

923
01:29:13,425 --> 01:29:15,695
 Blessed, dervish father. 

924
01:29:15,695 --> 01:29:17,425
 God bless you. 

925
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:35,295
 I've been traveling all this breath. 

926
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,460
 I didn't come across like this. 

927
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,880
 The pouch does not give a pouch value, but ... 

928
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,140
 ... how expensive is that, girl? 

929
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,280
 Do not mention it. 

930
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,420
 Akçe comes from the servant, but Allah gives abundance. 

931
01:29:54,425 --> 01:29:56,335
 My dervish father is my gift to you. 

932
01:29:56,675 --> 01:29:58,345
 May there be my daughter. 

933
01:29:58,695 --> 01:30:01,095
 May you be old in two worlds. 

934
01:30:08,155 --> 01:30:10,485
 When yar is with yar ... 

935
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:12,335
 ... becomes old. 

936
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,940
 It would be Bahtiyar. 

937
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,060
 May God be with you. 

938
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,760
 Soundly. 

939
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,260
 No, Osman Bey. 

940
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,500
 Nice wolf wears lambskin. 

941
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,180
 Nice traitor ... 

942
01:30:53,635 --> 01:30:56,055
 ... looks like a crown and a cardigan and a dervish. 

943
01:31:01,715 --> 01:31:03,925
 I never watched this man know this. 

944
01:31:06,535 --> 01:31:09,235
 What treacherous gives up traitor. 

945
01:31:09,235 --> 01:31:11,095
 From what cruel cruelty. 

946
01:31:12,105 --> 01:31:14,705
 As long as we are in the future. 

947
01:31:19,755 --> 01:31:22,795
 Gonca Hatun, the bench is entrusted to you. 

948
01:31:22,965 --> 01:31:24,355
 You don't worry. 

949
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:49,480
 This is Osman Bey, son of Ertuğrul Gazi. 

950
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,200
 In the raid, we will open a business. 

951
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:52,880
 Kill Osman in the raid. 

952
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,580
 But Edabali's daughter Bala ... 

953
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,000
 ...I want it alive. 

954
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,240
 We will learn from him what we want. 

955
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,700
 How did you know that Bala Hatun was, sir? 

956
01:32:03,025 --> 01:32:05,465
 To become the disciple of Ahi Evran ... 

957
01:32:05,465 --> 01:32:07,495
 I saw it when I arrived at the door. 

958
01:32:08,645 --> 01:32:10,155
 He was with his father. 

959
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,120
 It was small then. 

960
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,440
 But his eyes ... 

961
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,200
 ... never changed. 

962
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:24,740
 Spruce. 

963
01:32:30,015 --> 01:32:31,955
 It came here like the wind. 

964
01:32:32,775 --> 01:32:35,105
 How did you do well, Alaca, Osman Bey? 

965
01:32:35,815 --> 01:32:37,355
 What was his healing? 

966
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:39,465
 Healing several versions ointment. 

967
01:32:40,775 --> 01:32:43,015
 And Bala Hatun, who had a love for you. 

968
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,765
 To enter the dangers with you ... 

969
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,520
 ... kept looking impatient. 

970
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,160
 You see, Osman Bey. 

971
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,140
 I am a strange craftsman in the hereafter. 

972
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:13,185
 Yesterday when I saw you tear at the beginning of the horse ... 

973
01:33:15,665 --> 01:33:17,125
 I made a promise to myself. 

974
01:33:18,235 --> 01:33:19,655
 What was this saying? 

975
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:24,640
 Whoever spills one drop of tears from the eyes of this chick ... 

976
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,900
 I said ... my dear enemy. 

977
01:33:43,585 --> 01:33:45,335
 Not our enemies ... 

978
01:33:46,085 --> 01:33:48,525
 ... but our loved ones hurt Osman Bey. 

979
01:33:49,775 --> 01:33:51,425
 May you be good cheer. 

980
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:06,515
 Mr. Osman! 

981
01:34:15,265 --> 01:34:16,735
 What do you want, bully? 

982
01:34:17,465 --> 01:34:20,775
 Mr. Alişar has heard news everywhere, sir, he will call you. 

983
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,080
 Not as a banner, as a hunting companion ... 

984
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,420
 He said he wanted to host you in his mansion. 

985
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,420
 Thank you. 

986
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,240
 Let's get together. 

987
01:34:38,295 --> 01:34:39,845
 Excuse me, Bala Hatun. 

988
01:34:40,745 --> 01:34:42,725
 I will come to see you at thesis time. 

989
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,300
 Osman Bey has a nod to you. 

990
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:29,960
 Stop! 

991
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,240
 Crap in Byzantium ... 

992
01:35:43,815 --> 01:35:45,765
 ... valiant does not end in registration. 

993
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,000
 Mr. Osman! 

994
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,700
 You are welcome. 

995
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,880
 We welcome Alişar Bey. 

996
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:45,980
 Here Basin. 

997
01:36:53,285 --> 01:36:56,085
 Let me offer you sherbet sherbet Osman. 

998
01:37:00,285 --> 01:37:03,585
 You threw the Kulucahisar Castle like a cotton ball. 

999
01:37:04,365 --> 01:37:06,185
 Our breath is on them. 

1000
01:37:08,435 --> 01:37:10,815
 They will see us even in their shadows. 

1001
01:37:11,715 --> 01:37:13,175
 To their slanders ... 

1002
01:37:13,655 --> 01:37:16,875
 ... we do not give passages to your cocks, evelallah. 

1003
01:37:24,745 --> 01:37:27,185
 I know you didn't kill Tekfur. 

1004
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:30,485
 If you killed ... 

1005
01:37:30,905 --> 01:37:33,025
 ... no one would hear the soul. 

1006
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:37,000
 You took out your hand from the sinister castle. 

1007
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,960
 From you... 

1008
01:37:43,265 --> 01:37:45,485
 ... if I had any suspicion ... 

1009
01:37:46,925 --> 01:37:48,665
 ... as a starboard ... 

1010
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:53,180
 ... finds you before you suck, throws you into the dungeon ... 

1011
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,280
 I would take him to court before the woman. 

1012
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,325
 I will drown them in their slander, Alişar Bey. 

1013
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:05,015
 Finding the murderers of Tekfur and my brother ... 

1014
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,715
 ... I will see their accounts. 

1015
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:11,155
 I would like a court for this. 

1016
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,220
 Coming to the court with my own foot ... 

1017
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,380
 I would like to be tried. 

1018
01:38:46,345 --> 01:38:47,485
 From this table ... 

1019
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,565
 ... the last time we got up ... 

1020
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:54,215
 ... we were full of hope. 

1021
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,740
 Be sure, Princess Sofia. 

1022
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,740
 The death of my friend Yorgo Polos ... 

1023
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,300
 ... after you ... 

1024
01:39:02,365 --> 01:39:04,035
 ... hurt us the most. 

1025
01:39:04,995 --> 01:39:08,385
 After serving my husband's murderer sentence ... 

1026
01:39:08,865 --> 01:39:11,405
 ... we will repeat that friendship again. 

1027
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:12,585
 Mr. Dundar. 

1028
01:39:12,935 --> 01:39:15,315
 A permanent peace in this land ... 

1029
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,240
 ... was our biggest dream with Yorgo Polos. 

1030
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:24,360
 And even the most important legacy he left ... 

1031
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,040
 ...This is. 

1032
01:39:36,605 --> 01:39:37,605
 Sir. 

1033
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:41,095
 Teokles was killed. 

1034
01:39:46,785 --> 01:39:47,785
 How? 

1035
01:39:55,065 --> 01:39:56,115
 Osman! 

1036
01:39:58,305 --> 01:39:59,745
 He did it. 

1037
01:40:00,115 --> 01:40:03,225
 Osman is not even here, princess. How come? 

1038
01:40:03,325 --> 01:40:05,765
 Nobody else than Osman could have done this. 

1039
01:40:06,235 --> 01:40:07,265
 That's enough! 

1040
01:40:14,065 --> 01:40:15,345
 Tekfur ... 

1041
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,760
 killed the traitors inside your castle. 

1042
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:19,640
 Almost... 

1043
01:40:19,985 --> 01:40:21,585
 ... we would believe you. 

1044
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:25,800
 We will discuss this in court, Mr. Dundar. 

1045
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:28,780
 In court ... 

1046
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,360
 ... if my nephew is justified and your hostility still continues ... 

1047
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,660
 ... let alone break where he thinks. 

1048
01:40:40,145 --> 01:40:41,755
 Cenk is cenk ... 

1049
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,280
 ... peace is ... 

1050
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,940
 peace. 

1051
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:49,700
 And this... 

1052
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:51,940
 ... you know that. 

1053
01:41:25,925 --> 01:41:28,255
 Obviously with Bamsı Bey's son ... 

1054
01:41:28,565 --> 01:41:31,875
 ... you think that Tekfur's murderers are the same people. 

1055
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,700
 With this reason, he sneaks into the castle and ... 

1056
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,380
 ... you wanted to talk to Tekfur. 

1057
01:41:37,945 --> 01:41:38,945
 Is that so? 

1058
01:41:39,535 --> 01:41:40,665
 It is true. 

1059
01:41:41,245 --> 01:41:43,635
 I talked to Tekfur before I died. 

1060
01:41:45,215 --> 01:41:46,545
 Did you speak? 

1061
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,800
 So tell me all you know. 

1062
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,480
 Before Tekfur died, Alişar Bey told me that the fitna spread from his own castle. 

1063
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,220
 I was the only one he trusted. 

1064
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:01,585
 Neither wife nor commander Kalanoz. 

1065
01:42:07,605 --> 01:42:09,635
 Cenk is at the door, Osman Bey. 

1066
01:42:10,615 --> 01:42:12,835
 It is not time to be silent either. 

1067
01:42:13,285 --> 01:42:14,485
 With Kayi ... 

1068
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,860
 ... Kulucahisar's cengi ... 

1069
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,540
 ... you took a look ... 

1070
01:42:19,415 --> 01:42:22,545
 ... Seljuk became Byzantine war. 

1071
01:42:24,735 --> 01:42:27,825
 Commander Kalanoz with Princess Sofia ... 

1072
01:42:28,095 --> 01:42:30,385
 he asked you to go to court. 

1073
01:42:30,945 --> 01:42:33,765
 You have also escaped from the dungeon. 

1074
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:37,400
 The court should be established on our land. 

1075
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,080
 Why is that? 

1076
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,380
 Why would you hesitate? 

1077
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,980
 Princess Sofia ... 

1078
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,300
 ... Commander Kalanoz ... 

1079
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,900
 ... they wanted to kill me before going to court. 

1080
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:56,855
 For this, he must have strong evidence in his hand. 

1081
01:42:56,855 --> 01:42:59,165
 You can be sure, Alişar Bey. 

1082
01:42:59,915 --> 01:43:02,305
 Everyone will see when the court is established. 

1083
01:43:02,815 --> 01:43:05,955
 I will prove that they are both murderers in court. 

1084
01:43:05,955 --> 01:43:07,785
 What about you, Osman Bey? 

1085
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,160
 Where does this end? Have you ever thought? 

1086
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:13,460
 If you stand by the truth ... 

1087
01:43:14,235 --> 01:43:16,785
 ... not me they are afraid. 

1088
01:43:29,305 --> 01:43:32,445
 If they were the target of a hunter like you ... 

1089
01:43:33,055 --> 01:43:34,575
 ... I say they are ruined. 

1090
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:38,800
 If we pull those two jackals into our own hunt ... 

1091
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,680
 ... I'll sing like a nightingale in court. 

1092
01:43:42,415 --> 01:43:43,415
 As long as... 

1093
01:43:44,415 --> 01:43:46,615
 ... trust me, Alişar Bey. 

1094
01:43:48,745 --> 01:43:50,025
 Be sure, Osman Bey. 

1095
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:52,660
 I will do my part. 

1096
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:54,760
 We smashed them! 

1097
01:45:29,305 --> 01:45:31,475
 The eyes of Catalonia are black children ... 

1098
01:45:32,715 --> 01:45:35,825
 The lion-hearted warriors of Prince Salvador ... 

1099
01:45:36,475 --> 01:45:39,675
 ... to leave scary stories behind you ... 

1100
01:45:39,715 --> 01:45:41,115
 ...Are you ready? 

1101
01:45:41,115 --> 01:45:41,840
 We're ready! 

1102
01:45:43,115 --> 01:45:44,325
 Are you ready? 

1103
01:45:44,325 --> 01:45:45,620
 We're ready! 

1104
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,360
 Are you ready? 

1105
01:45:50,645 --> 01:45:51,645
 To us... 

1106
01:45:51,725 --> 01:45:55,145
 ... they will say Prince Salvador's brutal soldiers. 

1107
01:45:56,015 --> 01:45:58,455
 They will scare their children with us. 

1108
01:46:00,155 --> 01:46:03,255
 Pregnant women will make low when we hear our name. 

1109
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:10,600
 The hair of young men will grow out of fear. 

1110
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:16,340
 For Prince Salvador! 

1111
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,840
 For the sea of ​​loot waiting for us! 

1112
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,080
 Now is the time of war! 

1113
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,320
 Salvador! Salvador! 

1114
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,520
 Salvador! 

1115
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,520
 Salvador! 

1116
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,580
 Salvador! 

1117
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:28,720
 Salvador! 

1118
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,840
 Salvador! 

1119
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,920
 Salvador! 

1120
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:40,020
 Salvador! 

1121
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:45,220
 Are you sure, Samsa sergeant? 

1122
01:46:45,905 --> 01:46:47,965
 Osman Bey, as I believe. 

1123
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,840
 Emmi. 

1124
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,060
 My brother. 

1125
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,560
 Batur. 

1126
01:47:08,735 --> 01:47:10,255
 I saw it with my eyes. 

1127
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,040
 That shroud called Teokles ... 

1128
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,880
 ... was between Dündar Bey and Gündüz Bey. Batur behind them. 

1129
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,760
 So the guy Sofia was chasing after me to kill me ... 

1130
01:47:20,765 --> 01:47:23,515
 ... will take me to the murderers of my brother Aybars ... 

1131
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,580
 ... they delivered the most important trump card to the castle? 

1132
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:29,800
 My brother Emmim and my brother were also there. 

1133
01:47:32,735 --> 01:47:33,735
 So... 

1134
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:37,125
 ... going to the cave after Boran ... 

1135
01:47:37,475 --> 01:47:39,125
 ... Batur, who kidnapped Teokles. 

1136
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:42,555
 Batur huh? 

1137
01:47:43,885 --> 01:47:44,885
 Batur he! 

1138
01:47:45,275 --> 01:47:46,275
 Batur. 

1139
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,460
 Batur! 

1140
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:50,300
 This will pay off the betrayal. 

1141
01:47:51,185 --> 01:47:52,745
 What will you do, Osman Bey? 

1142
01:47:54,925 --> 01:47:57,745
 I will bring them to the fairest court, Konuralp. 

1143
01:47:58,915 --> 01:48:00,725
 I will set up the court! 

1144
01:48:01,265 --> 01:48:03,595
 My witnesses are my martyred brother Aybars. 

1145
01:48:04,245 --> 01:48:06,815
 It will be Yorgo Polos, who was slaughtered in dishonest. 

1146
01:48:07,355 --> 01:48:09,695
 The woman of the court I will establish is my anger. 

1147
01:48:10,725 --> 01:48:12,595
 I'll have a hangover! 

1148
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:16,965
 I will judge them. 

1149
01:48:22,985 --> 01:48:25,105
 Because there is a good in every evil ... 

1150
01:48:25,255 --> 01:48:27,655
 ... they did not say wasted Gündüz. 

1151
01:48:27,805 --> 01:48:29,355
 You're right, Emmi. 

1152
01:48:29,905 --> 01:48:33,295
 The death of Teokles is also my brother Osman ... 

1153
01:48:33,315 --> 01:48:35,465
 Thank God he proved ... innocent. 

1154
01:48:44,325 --> 01:48:46,125
 You came on time, girl. 

1155
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,140
 My pain was burned. 

1156
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:49,680
 Healing, my father. 

1157
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:50,860
 Thanks. 

1158
01:48:51,415 --> 01:48:53,325
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1159
01:48:56,035 --> 01:48:57,035
 Thanks. 

1160
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,545
 The game he's playing has also appeared ... 

1161
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,980
 ... they cannot slander Osman informally. 

1162
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:21,840
 Emmi. 

1163
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:26,340
 We wish to see business and trade with these guys. 

1164
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,260
 ... zanlım by ... 

1165
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,420
 ... this castle boils like a cauldron. 

1166
01:49:30,985 --> 01:49:33,435
 Tekfur was first assassinated. 

1167
01:49:33,595 --> 01:49:34,775
 Now ... 

1168
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:36,820
 ... the man called Teokles. 

1169
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:41,220
 Obviously there is a big conflict behind the stone walls. 

1170
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:45,840
 Good or nephew. 

1171
01:49:46,655 --> 01:49:49,745
 The more it boils there ... 

1172
01:49:49,975 --> 01:49:52,925
 ... it will benefit us so much. 

1173
01:49:57,865 --> 01:49:59,485
 You say good. 

1174
01:49:59,925 --> 01:50:01,775
 Have a nice lesson ... 

1175
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:06,300
 ... if Osman is not as innocent as we think? 

1176
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,620
 What will happen to Dundar Bey and Batur, sir? 

1177
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,940
 All will pay their account! 

1178
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:49,380
 Samsa sergeant, you're out of here. 

1179
01:50:49,835 --> 01:50:52,845
 Do not worry, we are with Osman Bey. 

1180
01:52:17,925 --> 01:52:20,235
 Bala Hatun laughs in your eyes. 

1181
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,640
 I'll come. 

1182
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:23,180
 How was it? 

1183
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,100
 According to the smile of the face ... 

1184
01:52:26,285 --> 01:52:28,595
 ... Osman Bey has obviously made a good horse. 

1185
01:52:28,895 --> 01:52:31,115
 I don't know if he has healing. 

1186
01:52:31,115 --> 01:52:32,975
 He beat my horse well overnight. 

1187
01:52:33,195 --> 01:52:35,305
 I don't know if you have any healing. 

1188
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:39,420
 However, since he did well overnight ... 

1189
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,820
 ... his heart is not empty. 

1190
01:52:43,785 --> 01:52:46,005
 What do you mean, Gonca Hatun? 

1191
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:47,660
 Take out the pods in your mouth. 

1192
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,160
 I asked the customers from the apricot. 

1193
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:52,445
 Osman Bey does not have a chick. 

1194
01:53:00,305 --> 01:53:01,825
 Stout like that ... 

1195
01:53:01,945 --> 01:53:04,165
 ... necessarily has a baby. 

1196
01:53:05,105 --> 01:53:06,945
 I asked thoroughly, investigated. 

1197
01:53:07,595 --> 01:53:08,985
 There is no cub. 

1198
01:53:13,945 --> 01:53:15,215
 Both ... 

1199
01:53:15,565 --> 01:53:18,465
 ... why would you tell me these Gonca Hatun? 

1200
01:53:18,465 --> 01:53:20,775
 I saw how he looked at you on the counter. 

1201
01:53:22,265 --> 01:53:23,685
 [Aslı and Kerem.] 

1202
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,900
 Very nice thank you. 

1203
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,360
 Not that... 

1204
01:53:27,795 --> 01:53:29,235
 ... the only thing that ends is not tiles ... 

1205
01:53:30,575 --> 01:53:31,985
 ... the treatment of his horse is over. 

1206
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,800
 Aygül Hatun put herself in danger without blinking. 

1207
01:53:49,285 --> 01:53:50,495
 E is the daughter of the suck. 

1208
01:53:51,025 --> 01:53:52,075
 What would he do? 

1209
01:53:53,715 --> 01:53:55,355
 Would he let him die? 

1210
01:53:57,015 --> 01:53:59,885
 In a well-known heap like Osman ... 

1211
01:54:00,015 --> 01:54:01,455
 ... does it ever work? 

1212
01:54:05,025 --> 01:54:06,545
 Or are you jealous? 

1213
01:54:15,495 --> 01:54:17,325
 Put those pots on the stalls. 

1214
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:20,720
 A vacant bench is also a poll. 

1215
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,840
 Leave the stub, Bala Hatun. 

1216
01:54:23,535 --> 01:54:25,895
 I do not have the benches or polls ... 

1217
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,580
 ... you wipe a heart. 

1218
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:18,700
 Thanks. 

1219
01:56:25,635 --> 01:56:27,035
 They could be the market. 

1220
01:56:27,545 --> 01:56:28,655
 Become a market. 

1221
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:30,740
 You are welcome. 

1222
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,800
 Nice to you, chick. 

1223
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:35,360
 There's a white horse in the stable, they said it's yours. 

1224
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:37,380
 What happened to Alaca? 

1225
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:38,800
 He became grumpy and stopped. 

1226
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:42,200
 Now he is sick. Come and take a look. 

1227
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:44,680
 Let me see Gonca. 

1228
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:45,580
 Okay Bala Hatun. 

1229
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,040
 May you compare the counter. 

1230
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:07,240
 You don't worry, baby. 

1231
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:40,340
 I ate it! 

1232
01:58:21,485 --> 01:58:23,025
 You were so beautiful. 

1233
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:26,540
 It will be a pity for this beauty. 

1234
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,280
 Take it! 

1235
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:40,720
 Attack the market! Put everyone through the sword! 

1236
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:41,820
 Move! 

1237
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:16,100
 Welcome Osman Bey! 

1238
02:01:58,980 --> 02:01:59,940
 This is what you do ... 

1239
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,120
 ... he won't be near you, osman. 

1240
02:02:03,515 --> 02:02:05,295
 Excuse for romance ... 

1241
02:02:06,465 --> 02:02:08,835
 ... betrayal is not compensated. 

1242
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:21,760
 What do you do, sir? 

1243
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:47,680
 You're still chasing the damn, son. 

1244
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:02,080
 Now! 

1245
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:04,980
 Listen to me! 

1246
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,520
 Who sows fitna ... 

1247
02:03:11,825 --> 02:03:13,115
 ... treachery ... 

1248
02:03:14,515 --> 02:03:15,515
 Who is ... 

1249
02:03:15,985 --> 02:03:18,655
 ... if he tries to turn around after me! 

1250
02:03:20,315 --> 02:03:21,315
 I! 

1251
02:03:22,615 --> 02:03:24,965
 Ertuğrul Gazi's son Osman! 

1252
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,860
 The great post where my father was founded. 

1253
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:34,020
 A full-fledged banner that we live in. 

1254
02:03:35,145 --> 02:03:36,145
 And... 

1255
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:38,220
 ... I carry in my waist ... 

1256
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:40,260
 ... on my black pus ... 

1257
02:03:40,335 --> 02:03:41,445
 ... and I drink! 

1258
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,720
 I'm not hurt! 

1259
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:48,120
 Flood washes ... 

1260
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:50,360
 ... it will be a fire! 

1261
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:57,100
 Ear that doesn't hear my warnings ... 

1262
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:01,700
 ... the language to say words on ... 

1263
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:03,200
 ... I'll cut it up! 

1264
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:08,340
 It... 

1265
02:04:09,055 --> 02:04:10,465
 ... so to know ... 

1266
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:13,340
 ... so be said!

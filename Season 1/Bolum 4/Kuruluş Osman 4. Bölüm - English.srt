1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,300
 [Wolf howls.] 

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:01:57,060
 [Generic music.] 

3
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,700
 [The horse is sniffing.] 

4
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,900
 Were Constantine and Nikea's riches gone, you came here for the loot? 

5
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,380
 Don't talk too much woman! 

6
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,060
 (Screams.) 

7
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,720
 [Horses are turning.] 

8
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,600
 Don't touch him! 

9
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,020
 (Screams.) 

10
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,100
 Guys I ... 

11
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,120
 Neither Dundar Bey nor Gündüz Bey will pursue this business. 

12
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
 Boran gardaş ... 

13
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,820
 Everybody in this oba, this tip will know it well ... 

14
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,600
 ... whoever betrayed his son Osman, Ertuğrul Gazi, this is the end. 

15
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,260
 If I were silent about this betrayal today ... 

16
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,840
 How would I wander in this square because it was tomorrow sooner? 

17
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,620
 From my own blood today ... 

18
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,460
 ... if I had not sentenced this punishment to Batur, the son of my wife ... 

19
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
 ... if I separated those who betrayed tomorrow from us or by hand ... 

20
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,520
 ... would my father's labor be my mother's milk halal? 

21
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,820
 (They always say "thank you sir".) 

22
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,760
 Our lives are sacrificed for your justice and your path. 

23
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,340
 What are we going to do now, sir? 

24
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,440
 I did not pour this blood for dry apathy. Konur Alp. 

25
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:55,340
 This is the fate of whoever I am, not my brother, not who I am. 

26
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
 Everyone will know this well. 

27
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,480
 My son, I'm brave. 

28
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
 He meant my soul. 

29
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,780
 He wished to kill me. 

30
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,260
 Nothing will happen to you, do not worry, you do not worry. 

31
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,500
 Your mother's healing hands will do you good. 

32
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
 The mother wanted to kill me. 

33
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,480
 He meant my life. 

34
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,060
 Bring those diapers now, Burçin! 

35
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
 Nothing will happen to my brother, master? 

36
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,620
 The baht of the apricot chick is kneaded with blood. 

37
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,780
 It's not time for juicy eyed glasses. 

38
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,580
 Take those cloths. 

39
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,720
 Come on! 

40
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,680
 Quickly! 

41
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,020
 Let your bush pour hemp on chamomile. 

42
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,300
 Don't forget to boil the devil. 

43
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,860
 Zöhre mainstream. 

44
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,720
 Aygül, set up a stove here. 

45
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,940
 Mr. Demirci. 

46
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,900
 The trouble we have with the castle is known, we are vigilant. 

47
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,380
 I instructed the Alps, and they will bring their pusat to you in turn ... 

48
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,460
 ... take a roll. 

49
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,740
 Thank you Gündüz Beyim. 

50
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,780
 You should know that I do not want laziness and laziness. 

51
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,660
 Now, everyone is in charge, come on. 

52
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
 Thank you sir. 

53
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,700
 Is there any destim, sir? 

54
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,760
 You're coming. 

55
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,980
 (Breathless.) 

56
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,540
 Mr. Gündüz. 

57
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,420
 What happened? 

58
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,540
 Mr. Osman. 

59
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,020
 What happened to Osman Bey? 

60
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,180
 Osman Bey daggered Batur in front of Dundar Bey's bed. 

61
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,000
 [Door opens.] 

62
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,940
 [The door closes.] 

63
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,920
 Osman, don't let your hands hold a shield. 

64
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 Let your heart find blood! 

65
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,240
 If I betray you like your son, whatever you say is aunt. 

66
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,460
 Is your eye not saturated with blood? Now after Aybars ... 

67
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,180
 ... my son came to Batur? 

68
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,940
 [Shoots the dagger.] 

69
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,420
 You know... 

70
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,180
 ... they wash our lives with blood and blood. 

71
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,960
 Drop my hand Gündüz Bey! 

72
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,800
 Do you want unfair ... 

73
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,200
 ... justice or aunt? 

74
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,320
 Take your hand! 

75
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
 I want revenge, Mr. Gündüz. 

76
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,460
 Is there no sooner in your room, your voice is so loud Zöhre Hatun! 

77
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,140
 [The dagger falls to the ground.] 

78
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,580
 This is not done here, Osman. 

79
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
 You spilled my blood ... 

80
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,940
 ... if you wanted to make me experience the pain of the child ... 

81
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,100
 ... you will bear the informal price. 

82
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,580
 [Door opens.] 

83
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,880
 [The door closes.] 

84
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,440
 You finally got it, Osman. 

85
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,320
 You finally got it too. 

86
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,780
 Enough informal Osman! 

87
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,600
 When will you be quiet? 

88
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,940
 When will you stop, Osman? 

89
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,180
 When your betrayal ends, your brother will be stopped at that time. 

90
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,640
 No, you will not behave Osman. 

91
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,020
 You will not settle down. 

92
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,900
 Alps... 

93
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,440
 ... throw Osman Bey into the caged tent. 

94
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,800
 Ha betrayal, ha betrayal partnership ... 

95
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,100
 ... there is no difference for me, Mr. Gündüz! 

96
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,740
 I will submit to the ceremony because you are the brother of the alpine, not the brother. 

97
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,320
 I will ask you to account for them. 

98
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,680
 You know. 

99
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,600
 [Lightning sound.] 

100
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,180
 Son... 

101
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,100
 son. 

102
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 Son. 

103
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,680
 Son who fights like a maned lion with no mustache as his eyebrow. 

104
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,440
 When he fell ... 

105
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,740
 ... son standing like a starboard. 

106
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:56,500
 You've been home to this land, vote son! 

107
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,280
 Son, no. You are not dead. 

108
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,900
 Doesn't it create that place or the sky? 

109
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,880
 "They are not dead, you don't know." 

110
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,960
 We do not know, son, we do not know. 

111
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,200
 But... 

112
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,780
 ... those who follow you will know. 

113
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,980
 Son will know. 

114
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,840
 Son, if you don't fall ... 

115
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,340
 ... if I don't fall ... 

116
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,880
 How can this black land become a homeland? 

117
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,000
 (Breathes deeply.) 

118
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,420
 How can this land become a homeland? 

119
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
 [The horse is running.] 

120
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,100
 No, Erkut Alp, what is this fuss? 

121
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,560
 Beyim, Osman Bey daggered Batur in front of Dundar Bey's bed. 

122
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
 What about you, Erkut Alp, how about you? 

123
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,540
 Lets! 

124
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,440
 Come on, come on! 

125
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 [Horses are turning.] 

126
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,960
 [The door closes.] 

127
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,600
 Forgive me, Mr.. 

128
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,820
 Whatever the order says. 

129
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,720
 First, everyone should do their job. 

130
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,200
 Because of his duty, no one should be grieved, fellows. 

131
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,180
 (Shouts.) 

132
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,540
 Bring the goods! 

133
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,180
 So you're thirsty, look. 

134
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,480
 You can't even drink a sip without speaking! 

135
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,960
 [Door opens.] 

136
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,860
 Mr. Bamsı. 

137
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,780
 I Usman. 

138
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,220
 For what reason did I stack up? 

139
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,860
 Every betrayal has a price. 

140
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,340
 Batur ... 

141
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,580
 ... paid the price of his betrayal. 

142
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 Well, well then. 

143
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,720
 He found his right. But if you say I am Osman, what is his betrayal? 

144
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,080
 The greatest trump card to take us to my murderer Aybars murderers ... 

145
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,680
 ... handed over Teokles to the castle. 

146
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,420
 Who did Osman, who would have done this to us? 

147
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,120
 Emma ... 

148
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,180
 ...my brother... 

149
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,000
 ... Batur. 

150
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,120
 Whose blood is this? 

151
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,000
 Whose blood is this? 

152
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,860
 Mr. Osman... 

153
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,300
 ... attacked Batur, sir, Zöhre Hatun treats inside. 

154
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,440
 The lion of his father. 

155
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,400
 I Baturina. 

156
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,940
 You'll be fine, boy. 

157
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,340
 You will be fine. 

158
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,200
 Father meant to me. 

159
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,020
 Osman shed our blood. 

160
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,400
 O Osman ... 

161
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,280
 ... where did he flee? 

162
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,500
 In which node is it? 

163
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,660
 What he has erased, what he is afraid of. 

164
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,620
 This is Osman. He brought it into my eyes to say I did it well. 

165
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,540
 The price of the blood of the son of Dündar Bey ... 

166
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,920
 ... pay. 

167
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,960
 Father... 

168
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,600
 stop him. 

169
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,280
 Or it will be the end of all of us. 

170
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,080
 Mr. Dundar. 

171
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,720
 He put him in the cage tent during the day. 

172
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,560
 The emirate period is over, Dundar Bey. 

173
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,260
 Let Osman see his face after that. 

174
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,880
 I will now show you what is the bloodshed to Osman. 

175
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
 I'll show. 

176
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,840
 What would you do while Osman daggered my son? 

177
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,040
 Oh, what would you do! 

178
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,200
 Mr. Dundar! 

179
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,060
 Do you think what you are doing, Mr. Dundar? 

180
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,100
 How do you give the bait we will find the killers of my Aybars, Dundar Bey? 

181
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,620
 How would you deliver it to the castle? 

182
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,480
 In order not to experience new pains. 

183
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,060
 Valiant like Aybars ... 

184
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,640
 so that he doesn't lose. 

185
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,780
 On the one hand, the Mongols struggle to come over us ... 

186
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,860
 ... not to fight with Byzantium. 

187
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,040
 Bamsı Bey, so that my brother will keep our oblique until he returns. 

188
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,720
 Not that... 

189
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,160
 ... what did we give? 

190
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,120
 Ha? 

191
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:05,280
 Kayı's great hero Osman Bey infiltrated again and killed him in the castle. 

192
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
 Open your ears now, Bamsı Bey! 

193
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,740
 It is Osman who killed Teokles. 

194
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,880
 If it were not for the people, it would hurt my Batur. 

195
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,900
 Just me... 

196
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,020
 It was going to disassemble my lungs. 

197
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,420
 It was going to disassemble my lung. 

198
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,860
 Mr. Dundar ... 

199
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,740
 ... Osman's courage, Osman's horizon has broken your balance. 

200
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,560
 If it gets dust from the wind, you will know from Osman. 

201
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,500
 From the death of Yorgopolos ... 

202
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,140
 ... to Teokles' murder ... 

203
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,140
 ... in each case, all arrows show Osman. 

204
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,040
 Do not join Osman's caravan and cast a shadow on Kayı's fortune! 

205
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,640
 Open your eyes now! 

206
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,160
 See the truth now. 

207
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,300
 You know what I see when I open my eyes and look at you? 

208
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,120
 What do I see when I look at you? 

209
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,580
 I see the laziness, the laziness when I look at you. 

210
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,160
 It's not sloth ... 

211
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,080
 ... vigilance Bamsı Bey, vigilance. 

212
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,020
 The scales of Bitinya are like sensitive scales. 

213
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,360
 I will not let Osman Osman act according to his own head and hurt people. 

214
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,340
 You will not see! 

215
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,820
 Osman Ertuğrul Bey is entrusted to me. 

216
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,880
 I do not make Osman to you, Dündar Bey! 

217
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,300
 I blow one! 

218
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
 We did not find this object on the road, Bamsı Bey. 

219
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,680
 I am Son of Süleyman Shah, Dundar! 

220
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:05,900
 If it was my nephew who was not referring to Kayı's fortunate, my own son who was dying inside 

221
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,940
 ... sorry, I wash! 

222
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,760
 I, Bamsı Beyrek ... 

223
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,960
 As long as I am alive, no one can touch Osman! 

224
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:30,720
 I swallow anger, Dundar Bey, I breathe blood, vomit fire; I burn it Mr. Dundar! 

225
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,660
 I will burn, I will burn Dündar! 

226
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,980
 [Door opens.] 

227
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,940
 [The door closes.] 

228
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,220
 Beyim will be an important event. 

229
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,100
 What happened? 

230
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,780
 They have printed the new market, sir. 

231
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,620
 They put everyone on the sword. 

232
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,140
 How about you? Inform Gündüz Bey immediately. 

233
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,460
 We're going to the new market, now! 

234
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,900
 Sir, sir. 

235
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,780
 [The door closes.] 

236
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,380
 When I get back, I will show up with that Osman. 

237
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,400
 I'll settle. 

238
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,660
 [Door opens.] 

239
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,420
 You go out. 

240
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,640
 [The door closes.] 

241
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,340
 Today... 

242
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,060
 ... you found your hand in blood, Osman. 

243
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,240
 Today... 

244
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,760
 ... you spilled the blood of one of your own blood, Osman! 

245
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,200
 And now to me ... 

246
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,300
 ... where will this end? 

247
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,120
 Ha? What will be the end of this? 

248
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,000
 I spilled the dirty blood that poisoned her for her apricots, brother. 

249
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,580
 This is just the beginning. 

250
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,020
 Be careful, you will not fail again. 

251
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,260
 I'm not Batur Osman, have you heard? 

252
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,300
 I'm not Batur! 

253
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,980
 I will sculpt the eyes of the man who will slap me! 

254
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,180
 Know your limits! 

255
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,200
 Or... 

256
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,880
 ... I don't say I'm a garbage ... 

257
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,020
 ... I don't wait for my father ... 

258
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,680
 ... I take your liver off with my hands, Osman! 

259
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,980
 Everything is in the square. 

260
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,700
 Both blindness and betrayal. 

261
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,600
 Not me... 

262
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,360
 ... you fear! 

263
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,860
 (Laughs.) 

264
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,560
 Osman... 

265
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,540
 ... while you cry in the cradle ... 

266
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,860
 ... I taught my father the profession called politics. 

267
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,360
 The point is, Osman. 

268
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,420
 What is it? 

269
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,560
 Sometimes, there were various kinds of games for futuhat, what? 

270
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,080
 Someone like you couldn't comprehend these games. 

271
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,060
 (He stands up angrily.) 

272
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,700
 Gündüz Bey has published a new market. 

273
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,700
 Dündar Bey will call you thesis, you will start the new market with the alps. 

274
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 Bala Hatun ... 

275
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,380
 Brother. 

276
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,680
 Let me untie my hands. 

277
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,900
 Osman, so we can open up new trouble for us? 

278
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,300
 Untie my hands! 

279
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,440
 The thesis is necessary to go to the new market. 

280
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,520
 Let me see you ... 

281
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,340
 What are you involved in this business? 

282
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
 Sanane from the new market! 

283
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,200
 Brother! 

284
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,020
 First of all, how will you protect yourself from the rush of the kefer called Kalanoz? 

285
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,940
 Brother! 

286
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,720
 My brother, untie my hands! 

287
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,220
 Solve! 

288
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,300
 Osman... 

289
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,560
 ... whenever I wish, you will leave here. 

290
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,400
 Those chains will not be untied until my father comes. 

291
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,200
 (Angrily.) Big brother! 

292
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,920
 (Screams.) 

293
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:05,060
 (They all have fun and laugh together.) 

294
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,580
 Do you want to go? 

295
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,380
 (Screams.) 

296
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,840
 You will drown in your persecution! 

297
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,880
 Shut up! 

298
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,440
 Bring wine. 

299
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,200
 O God, you will not be burdened by anyone. 

300
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,640
 Give me the mother of Sumeyye mother. 

301
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,280
 Allow him to be a martyr like him. 

302
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,180
 Give me strength. 

303
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,000
 Yesterday when I saw you tear at the beginning of the horse ... 

304
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,840
 I made a promise to myself. 

305
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,100
 Whoever spills a single drop of age because of this chick ... 

306
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,120
 I said ... my dear enemy. 

307
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,680
 (Screams.) 

308
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,600
 Mr. Bamsı, let me solve me. 

309
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,960
 Before my anger comes down to you like a storm, you can unlock these locks. 

310
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,140
 Then if you chained each other. 

311
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,320
 Guys I ... 

312
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
 Come on, let me do what I say. 

313
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,500
 Come on, come on. 

314
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,140
 Thank you Bamsı Bey, they have printed the new market. 

315
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,600
 Let us be on the move thesis time. 

316
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,260
 Let's be my lion, come on. 

317
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,900
 Let's hurry. 

318
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
 Valiant warriors of Catalonia ... 

319
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,860
 ... I raise my glass for you. 

320
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,560
 (They always laugh with a mouth.) 

321
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,340
 Don't you have a conscience? 

322
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,340
 Some water. 

323
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,280
 You heard about Salvador. 

324
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,120
 No water until you speak. 

325
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,840
 Do you think you came from Catalonia to here to talk to me? 

326
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,460
 What are you talking about? 

327
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,320
 Come on come, I'll say come. 

328
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,860
 Come. 

329
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,080
 You're not afraid of a woman, do you? 

330
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,280
 Idiot... 

331
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
 ... the wolf would be the male or female. 

332
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,980
 Flee! 

333
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,400
 Catch the girl, quickly after the run! 

334
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,060
 (They cry out to run, catch.) 

335
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,940
 Quickly! 

336
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,020
 (Coughs.) 

337
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,240
 Zöhre Hatun. 

338
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,340
 Bamsı Bey kidnapped Osman from the caged tent. 

339
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,460
 Before one of the troubles he brought us happened, the other began. 

340
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,540
 You fell trapped. 

341
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,100
 I will break your head! 

342
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,300
 (He breathes.) 

343
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,500
 (Screams.) 

344
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
 (Screams.) 

345
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,720
 (He has difficulty breathing.) 

346
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,940
 I'll break your neck if you try to escape again. 

347
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,240
 (She's barely breathing.) 

348
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,320
 Take it! 

349
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,140
 Mr. Osman. 

350
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,700
 Mr. Tursun. 

351
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,680
 I was coming to you, Osman Bey. 

352
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,480
 What happened in the new market, Tursun Bey? 

353
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,680
 Bamsı Bey, the father knows everything halfway. 

354
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,880
 They broke the new market and killed everyone. 

355
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,780
 Gonca Hatun was injured. 

356
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
 What about Bala Hatun? 

357
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,260
 Or something happened to him? 

358
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,120
 They kidnapped Bala Hatun. 

359
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,920
 Did they do it? 

360
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,360
 Who knows who made it, Osman Bey. 

361
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,520
 However, no soldiers came out of the castle. 

362
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,420
 They must have found someone to get this job done. 

363
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,560
 I don't know who they are. 

364
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,500
 They took him to a secret place. 

365
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,240
 I can't return to the castle. As soon as Sofia Bala Hatun sees, she will understand the contact with each other. 

366
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,040
 Because Bala Hatun saw me together. 

367
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,480
 From now on, I'm with you, Osman. 

368
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,040
 We can only save Bala Hatun from the hands of those murderers. 

369
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,780
 You will go to the castle, Tursun Efendi. 

370
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,780
 Why is that, sir? 

371
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,280
 If they wanted to kill Bala Hatun, they would do it at the market place. 

372
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
 They will want to torture and question you. 

373
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,020
 When they have no information from you, they will take you to Bala to face you. 

374
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,860
 Thank you sir. 

375
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,180
 Thank you. 

376
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,940
 We're going to crash over. 

377
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,380
 Storm. 

378
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,220
 Come on, sir. 

379
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,140
 Tursun Efendi ... 

380
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,220
 ... will take us to Bala Hatun. 

381
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
 You will go after Konur Alp. 

382
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,160
 We will wait for the news in Samsa Sergeant's oba. 

383
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,960
 This is yours, sir. 

384
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
 Say something like that to me ... 

385
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,380
 ... my anger should not swallow you. 

386
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,580
 In the daytime, when my great middle market is published ... 

387
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,460
 ... what would you do? 

388
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
 What would you do? 

389
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,820
 They were very crowded, they came at once. 

390
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,800
 This is how it comes suddenly. 

391
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,560
 (He cuts his throat.) 

392
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,180
 Are you scarecrow? 

393
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,160
 The pusats in your waist to sell? 

394
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,300
 Why do I feed you? 

395
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,280
 Ha? 

396
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,980
 Why is that? 

397
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,560
 Why is that? 

398
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,880
 Those who do not deserve the bite passing through the throat do not need the throat either. 

399
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,980
 You asked the other day. 

400
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,880
 Sir, which scent would you like so much? 

401
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,900
 Guys I ... 

402
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,500
 ... let me answer now, Nizamettin Efendi. 

403
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,600
 (Cocci). 

404
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
 Blood smell. 

405
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,200
 Don't tilt your head. 

406
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,400
 Now I'm going to ask ... 

407
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,180
 ... you will answer too. 

408
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,020
 Okay? 

409
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,040
 Your command is on my head, sir. 

410
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,220
 Even pushes will bark when the door is waiting. 

411
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,940
 Did you ever bark? 

412
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,740
 What is this market like? 

413
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,660
 Guys I ... 

414
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,640
 ... let me be the victim, sir, we did not. 

415
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,900
 Lift them into the forest. 

416
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,360
 It did not help us, be it wolves and birds. 

417
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,960
 You will shoot with your back, not with the sun. 

418
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,360
 Yeah like that. 

419
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,440
 Look son ... 

420
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,860
 I made this bow from maple. 

421
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,480
 It is also the buffalo bone under the skin. 

422
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,660
 I wrapped the leather with my own hands. 

423
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,940
 I will say that ... 

424
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:43,120
 All creatures remained breathless so that they could reach the arrow range that you threw. 

425
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,480
 Er is that he should not take the bow in his hand; or you shoot it. 

426
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,060
 Now wish you to take this bow? 

427
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,240
 (Laughs.) 

428
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,300
 [Hit the drum.] 

429
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,660
 Mr. Osman. 

430
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,360
 Mr. Bey, welcome you. 

431
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,160
 We enjoyed it. 

432
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,460
 If you had noticed, I would have overtaken you by folder. 

433
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
 You're not late, Samsa Sergeant. 

434
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,740
 You added glory to my glory. 

435
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,200
 Not with the folder, coach, let all the creatures in your hands be victim to your path. 

436
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,320
 But you don't seem to have come to feast too much. 

437
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,160
 We'll be a guest for you for a while, Samsa Sergeant. 

438
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,580
 In our informal obes, he does not have a comfortable face. 

439
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,000
 If you say Oba here ... 

440
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,400
 ... if you say it is here. 

441
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,220
 If you say Otağ, here it is. 

442
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,180
 My head is superior. 

443
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,440
 Thank you Samsa Sergeant. 

444
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,360
 Get well, Alişar Bey. 

445
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,400
 Dundar Bey does not pass with easy. 

446
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,500
 The banner of the starboard brain has been printed ... 

447
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,000
 ... there is no peace for anyone. 

448
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,480
 I am a hunter in the woods. 

449
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,240
 You are in Cenk Square. 

450
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,700
 Say who did this job? 

451
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,500
 My enemy is certain, my wife is certain, Alişar Bey. 

452
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,260
 Kulucahisar will come out if he does it. 

453
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,520
 No one can make such a loot other than Kalanoz. 

454
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:41,540
 Kalanoz, let's see who will save you from my hand? 

455
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,240
 No. 

456
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,140
 Are you all right? 

457
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,820
 (Crying). 

458
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,500
 Babe. 

459
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,380
 Chick are you okay 

460
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,080
 I am Dündar from Kayı Obası. 

461
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,940
 Osman Bey's absorption? 

462
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,180
 I am his brother Gündüz. 

463
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,760
 Tell me what happened, chick. 

464
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,260
 You can tell Osman Bey ... 

465
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,520
 ... they killed everyone, they kidnapped Bala Hatun. 

466
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,680
 What does it have to do with Osman Bey? 

467
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,200
 Who is Bala Hatun? 

468
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,320
 Why did they miss Bala Hatun while they were killing everyone? 

469
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,860
 What is a cheerleader girl, what does he have to do with Osman? 

470
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,660
 (Dig.) 

471
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,280
 Take this to the oba. May Zöhre Hatun treat this. 

472
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,780
 I will also come and learn everything. 

473
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,720
 Lets. 

474
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:32,580
 I will learn everything, you will be the first to know, Alişar Bey. 

475
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,460
 Now it is time to go to the castle and get it underwater. 

476
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,900
 Be vigilant, Mr. Dundar. 

477
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,740
 Wait for news from your Sancak Bey. 

478
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,560
 Cenk is at the door. 

479
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,340
 Beyim, Osman Bey escaped from the oba with the alps. 

480
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,140
 How about you? 

481
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,980
 Mr. Bey was not alone, Bamsı Bey also went with them. 

482
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,240
 Don't let him escape again or I'll kill you all. 

483
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,380
 There are those coming! 

484
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,460
 Princess Sofia. 

485
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,360
 Welcome. 

486
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,580
 The noble prince of Catalonia, Salvador. 

487
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,120
 I knew you would handle this job very easily. 

488
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,840
 Prince. 

489
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,140
 So this is Balaba's daughter Bala. 

490
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,360
 Cetinceviz came out. 

491
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,580
 Master Yannis knows how to break his shell. 

492
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,920
 Did something happen, Princess Sofia? 

493
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,800
 I know it. 

494
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,140
 I saw him in the castle, dressed as a nun. 

495
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,000
 Priest... 

496
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,940
 ... was next to the priest Marcus. 

497
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,800
 What does that mean? 

498
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,740
 The priest of our church was also from them. 

499
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,180
 He was the spy of Edebalı. 

500
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,300
 Damn it! 

501
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,500
 He's been in the church for two years. 

502
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,020
 So it tricked us all. 

503
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,880
 How can they do that? 

504
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,560
 I will scrape all of them. 

505
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,380
 Do not approach! 

506
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,740
 Or I'll cut this woman's throat. 

507
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,200
 Let me go and I'll leave this woman. 

508
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,760
 Bala. 

509
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,460
 Leave me. 

510
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,100
 My name is not Bala, you are confusing me with someone else. 

511
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,520
 I don't know any of you. 

512
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,860
 Get out or I'll kill the woman. 

513
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,020
 Let me go, this is my last warning to you! 

514
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,420
 I said get out! 

515
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,060
 Didn't you know me, Bala? 

516
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,120
 When I last saw you, you were disguised as nun. 

517
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,320
 Ha? 

518
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,140
 Next to him was the church pastor. 

519
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,840
 What kind of game is this? 

520
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,040
 I'm a simple chere girl in the new market. 

521
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,100
 Your father is also Edebalı. 

522
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,720
 Get him! 

523
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,820
 Get out! 

524
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,480
 I don't even care to die. 

525
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,780
 Do not! 

526
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:34,980
 Salvador! 

527
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,600
 Finish him. 

528
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,280
 (Screams.) 

529
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,720
 (They scream.) 

530
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
 Princess Sofia are you okay? 

531
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,000
 Salvador... 

532
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,680
 ... send this snake to Master Yannis. 

533
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,520
 Let him know what happened. 

534
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,080
 Princess Sofia, whatever you want. 

535
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,040
 Helin, we're going to the castle. 

536
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:33,500
 Let's see what kind of a devil was under Marcus' priest's clothing, let's find out. 

537
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,780
 Where am I? 

538
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,220
 Who are you? 

539
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,680
 Don't worry chick, don't worry. 

540
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,920
 You are in safe hands, in Kayı Obası. 

541
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,600
 You were injured, you fainted in the market place. 

542
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,100
 God bless you. 

543
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,460
 We bothered. 

544
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,740
 With that, thank God. 

545
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,740
 You got rid of it, chick. 

546
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,100
 It is the old scar on the neck. 

547
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,060
 Obviously you didn't hit it for the first time, babe. 

548
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,760
 Does your hand hold pusat? 

549
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,420
 Anxiety of life ... 

550
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,700
 ... what gets people to do. 

551
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,400
 The herds of monsters have been snatched. 

552
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,100
 Why did they do this? 

553
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,640
 Is the cruel persecution asked, chick? 

554
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,480
 Obviously, demons broke through. 

555
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,980
 We are traders in the market. 

556
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,600
 Thank you framing. 

557
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,040
 Steal ointment on his leg. 

558
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,600
 Let the shell bind. 

559
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,840
 Sew an alpine on his head, so that he does not part. 

560
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,280
 [Door opens.] 

561
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,300
 Alişar Bey. 

562
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,480
 Did you press the market, Princess Sofia? 

563
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,140
 Welcome. 

564
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,000
 I did not welcome. 

565
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,760
 Tell me... 

566
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,620
 ... they printed the market with your order? 

567
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,520
 Mr. Alişar ... 

568
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,500
 ... I've lived enough in these extreme lands to know how sensitive the balances are. 

569
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,260
 Being ignorant is not enough to do such a job ... 

570
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,040
 ... you have to be stupid. 

571
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,600
 Who, who did it then? 

572
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:15,440
 Who was thirsty on my land enough to break my market? 

573
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,360
 Alişar Bey. 

574
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:25,280
 We do not know who stepped the market. You know well that we will not do such a thing. 

575
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:35,560
 Behind you threatening us by coming with your soldiers and guns up to pencil 

576
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,280
 ... is there anything else? 

577
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:47,140
 Whoever is behind this job is the only place to escape. 

578
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,140
 Everybody knows ... 

579
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,680
 ... you are the scales in this land, Alişar Bey. 

580
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:04,900
 If we are on one side of the shroud, there is Kayı Obası on the other. 

581
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:10,800
 Did you threaten them, just as you threatened us? 

582
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:15,180
 Dundar Bey learned about the news of the printing of the market afterwards. 

583
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,620
 And why would they do that? 

584
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,160
 What about Osman? 

585
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,620
 Did Osman learn later? 

586
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:38,140
 Nobody else could have done this work. 

587
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,820
 Why should Osman do? 

588
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,040
 That's why he did it if he killed my husband. 

589
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,940
 That's all he wants, to end peace. 

590
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:58,620
 There is no other goal for him to be a warrior in this land. 

591
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,600
 Then there is only one way to understand this. 

592
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:24,800
 We will go to Kayı Obası, princess. 

593
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,900
 Is Osman there? 

594
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,220
 Osman in a caged tent. 

595
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,500
 The dem is the confrontation. 

596
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,380
 Whatever unreal is going to come out. 

597
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,600
 And god told them ... 

598
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:04,240
 ... when they give the punishment they deserve, they will understand why. 

599
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,800
 Because they drifted after their desires ... 

600
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,320
 they won't know what it is to be human. 

601
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:15,960
 [Door opens.] 

602
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,520
 What do you think you are doing in God's house? 

603
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,540
 What are you doing here? 

604
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,360
 God's house, huh? 

605
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,680
 I can kill you with my hands, old man. 

606
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,880
 My hands! 

607
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,800
 What do you want from me? I'm an innocent priest! 

608
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,780
 You mean an innocent priest? 

609
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,180
 You came to the end of the road. 

610
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,860
 Pastor Marcus. 

611
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,640
 Take it! 

612
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,500
 Since the day I was wearing my puspers ... 

613
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,360
 ... my Lord against the oppressors ... 

614
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,700
 ... gave us the opportunity to fight. 

615
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,160
 My husband, I said unworthy is not worthy of pus 

616
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,240
 However, I was fired with my Osman. 

617
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,640
 My son, my dear, my Aybars ... 

618
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,720
 ... drank martyrdom. 

619
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,000
 That's when ... 

620
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,620
 ... my soul got up again. 

621
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,780
 Osman... 

622
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,380
 ... boy, you exist! 

623
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,180
 May you be my land Osman! 

624
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,060
 May you exist. 

625
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:27,700
 My son and my obey, my dear, are sacrificing their way, Osman Bey. 

626
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,000
 Give me my command ... 

627
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,640
 ... let's conquer the dormitories in the dorm ... 

628
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,240
 ... let's overturn the walls. 

629
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,600
 Thank you Samsa Sergeant. 

630
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,240
 Thank you. 

631
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,680
 It is the crown of plums that we put on our heads in a pile like you. 

632
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:49,280
 But let's say we saved the captive Bala Hatun ... 

633
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,740
 What about the motherland? 

634
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,220
 The Mongolian horny beast, coffees never end in Byzantium ... 

635
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,480
 ... the fire of fire burns Turkish oba ashes. 

636
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,400
 Did we say Dundar Bey to war, too? 

637
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:07,700
 Times have changed, time has changed, Samsa Sergeant. 

638
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,340
 Non... 

639
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,580
 ... lightning without breathing, we will inhale the apha! 

640
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:22,680
 Our pusat will come out not to sheathe! 

641
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:33,100
 None of our comrades who will fit their ego will be with us. 

642
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,080
 We will always be fresh, we will always be fresh. 

643
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,540
 We will shed the blood of the cruel so much ... 

644
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,080
 ... our reputation will spread fear to all hearts. 

645
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:51,820
 I... 

646
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,020
 ... Osman, son of Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

647
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,200
 ... swear by the mad foals circulating in my blood ... 

648
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,420
 ... I will light the resurrection fire. 

649
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:19,320
 In this fire, I will ash the snakes, the fallen and the sellers. 

650
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,340
 My friends, we will succeed! 

651
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,220
 I hope we will succeed. 

652
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,940
 We will succeed, we will succeed, I hope. 

653
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,140
 Is there a destruction, Osman Bey? 

654
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:34,840
 You're coming. 

655
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,960
 You were right, sir, they had Tursun pending. 

656
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,320
 They threw it in the dungeon. 

657
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
 But Boran is in the neck of gardaş. 

658
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,800
 Bala Hatun cannot be in the dungeon. 

659
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,980
 They will take him with him tomorrow. 

660
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,040
 Tomorrow we must act against them all the world. 

661
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,900
 Hopefully Boran does not make a mistake. 

662
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,980
 I hope Boran will inform us when they take Gardaş Tursun. 

663
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:09,840
 Joyful... 

664
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,300
 ... you're a dervish in the New Market. 

665
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:20,740
 Your father is smart enough to raise a literary dervish and become a priest. 

666
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,960
 Look at me, old man ... 

667
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,940
 ... my father's name is not Edebalı! 

668
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,660
 Who said priest, what would you talk about? 

669
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,480
 Faith, intelligence, courage in your father; Do you think we don't have Bala Hatun? 

670
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,320
 I don't know a guy named Bala Hatun. 

671
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,280
 (Screams.) 

672
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,580
 Once upon a time in Kırşehir, you were with Ahi Evran with your father. 

673
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,420
 I came to your door to be a dervish. 

674
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,500
 I know your childhood. 

675
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:59,600
 I won't forget those beautiful eyes, a thousand years later, Bala. 

676
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,800
 You are Yannis. 

677
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:11,020
 Ahi Evran denounced and killed the Mongols. 

678
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,500
 So your father told you everything about me. 

679
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,800
 I know your nibble, Yannis! 

680
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,160
 You won't get what you want! 

681
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,980
 Don't talk so sure, girl. 

682
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,220
 In this plate I made with love of Ahilik, I present you death. 

683
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:36,720
 The poison in the red bottle will break your will and tell you everything. 

684
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:40,040
 Then you will slowly die. 

685
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,280
 But you will find your healing in a blue bottle whenever you want. 

686
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,700
 (Laughs.) 

687
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,640
 Then I will set you free. 

688
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:01,740
 Don't make me have a little girl killed as I know her childhood! 

689
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:05,340
 (Screams.) 

690
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:06,520
 Why is that? 

691
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:11,860
 Hold it! 

692
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:15,760
 No! 

693
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,260
 Open your mouth! 

694
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,840
 No! 

695
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,180
 Open your mouth! 

696
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,520
 (Laughs.) 

697
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:33,400
 You are brave as you own, your eyes are black; you will not give up, you will not surrender. 

698
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,260
 I'll save you from that swamp, Bala. 

699
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,160
 I Usman. 

700
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
 Mr. Bamsı. 

701
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,480
 Let it be there, come. 

702
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,640
 Osman, I saw you a lot of pensive. 

703
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,860
 What's on your behalf? 

704
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,080
 Tursun ... 

705
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,860
 ... Will Turcep acep be able to follow those angels? 

706
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,540
 I think of it. 

707
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:40,900
 Son, do you think Tursun or daughter of Edebalı? 

708
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,620
 Both of them. 

709
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,680
 They will take us to the land of those oppressors. 

710
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,920
 Vote. 

711
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:03,260
 Oy, my valiant Osman, whose blood flows madly. 

712
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:17,440
 Now, do you get your love off from calling your love? 

713
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,000
 Son ... 

714
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:32,440
 ... means a homeland, a homeland, a lonely pusat and a leather shield? 

715
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,260
 Do the bricks that rise to the sky mean the horses that run for four? 

716
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:44,520
 Osman is not only a country, it is an oba, a tip. 

717
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,440
 Homeland means love. 

718
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,240
 It means love. 

719
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,500
 It means yar. 

720
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:11,640
 Son, Yarsub of Oğuz Kağan, Selcen of Alparslan; If Suleiman Shah had no Hayme ... 

721
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,140
 how would they endure so much? 

722
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:19,140
 How would they accomplish those unbelievable big jobs? 

723
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:28,660
 Son, erect the horse; bind the mad of the brave, yar. 

724
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,940
 May my Lord grant the best for all of us. 

725
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:39,820
 Hopefully the game we have set up will result. 

726
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,840
 Tursun resists torture. It resists ... 

727
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,400
 ... we reach our goal. 

728
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,600
 May my Lord give Tursun the strength of stamina. 

729
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,620
 Amen Osman, amen. 

730
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,920
 No one can save you from here! 

731
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,160
 You'd better start talking. 

732
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,760
 Even your father cannot save you Edebalı. 

733
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,420
 Osman. 

734
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,360
 Osman. 

735
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,540
 It saves me. 

736
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,820
 (Coughing.) 

737
01:18:52,940 --> 01:19:01,740
 (Shouts.) 

738
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,820
 (She's barely breathing.) 

739
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,200
 Tell me, pastor Marcus ... 

740
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,240
 ... your name is a lie like everything? 

741
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,360
 Stop for the love of the holy Mary! 

742
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,960
 I beg you, what do you want from me! 

743
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,120
 I'm a pastor! 

744
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,920
 I am a servant servant of God. 

745
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:45,200
 Ask Buyukada Metropolitanism, they will know me! 

746
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,600
 (Crying). 

747
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,640
 You will kill, do not beg! 

748
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,840
 Stand in the name of Jesus! 

749
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,660
 (She's barely breathing.) 

750
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,840
 Stand in the name of Jesus! 

751
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:23,500
 (Shouts.) 

752
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,260
 Did he still speak? 

753
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,240
 He still claims to be pastor Marcus. 

754
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,900
 I can't wait for a response from the metropolitan. 

755
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,680
 We must capture the sacred trust and treasure as soon as possible. 

756
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,240
 On behalf of our Meyem Mother ... 

757
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,100
 ... I'm begging you, princess. 

758
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,500
 Pray with me, pastor Marcus. 

759
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,220
 On behalf of our Virgin Mary ... 

760
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,280
 ... hear my prayers. 

761
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:59,540
 Lord, listen to my pleadings. 

762
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,560
 Respond to me with your loyalty, righteousness. 

763
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,620
 Don't judge with your servant because no creature ... 

764
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,780
 ... not justified. 

765
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,080
 Princess Sofia... 

766
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,140
 ... you know me. 

767
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,640
 I beg you, believe me! 

768
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:51,680
 [Thriller music] 

769
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,540
 No. 

770
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,540
 No! 

771
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:41,840
 (Yells with pain.) 

772
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,420
 (Yells with resentment.) 

773
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,600
 He taught him well. 

774
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,420
 Let them take you to Bala Hatun. 

775
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,640
 Master Yannis will make them speak. 

776
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,220
 Can you make someone talk so well-educated? 

777
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,500
 Even if he normally dies, he does not speak. 

778
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:34,540
 But so that the daughter of the sheikh, Bala Hatun, will not die ... 

779
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,560
 ... the language will be resolved. 

780
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,520
 He was thoroughly ecstatic. 

781
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,120
 I think he fell tired. 

782
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,560
 When he wakes up, he will whimper the wound again. 

783
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,480
 Then I'll go to a hospital and bring it from boiling herbs. 

784
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,440
 When we wake up, we drink. 

785
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,720
 Also change them. 

786
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,080
 Where did Aygül go? 

787
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,780
 Zöhre mother went to buy herbal herbs. 

788
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,680
 He hits the fire outside. 

789
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,280
 I hope it will be better. 

790
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,540
 God willing. 

791
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:18,940
 Burcin. 

792
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,420
 Come sit down girl. 

793
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,300
 Ever since your father died in Mongolian trouble ... 

794
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,460
 ... you grew up on my slope. 

795
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,600
 You know I won't keep you apart from my children. 

796
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,500
 I don't see you separate from my mother, Zöhre mother. 

797
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,140
 You are Aygül, you are closer than me. 

798
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,480
 There is a strangeness in the last few days. 

799
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,460
 What's the matter, Burçin? 

800
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,960
 What happened shook him Zöhre main. 

801
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,560
 Burcin ... 

802
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:18,360
 He is afraid to say ... 

803
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,460
 but I know. 

804
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,900
 What do you know my daughter? 

805
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:33,760
 Aygül is burnt to Osman Zöhre mother. 

806
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,860
 Can't say it will ar. 

807
01:27:58,620 --> 01:27:59,700
 Is there a destruction? 

808
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,920
 Come on, Samsa Sergeant. 

809
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:18,860
 You bring leg with your hand and sell vinegar with your face. 

810
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,080
 Do you envy us, Samsa Sergeant? 

811
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,020
 Selling vinegar is better than selling comrades. 

812
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,360
 What was your attitude like that? 

813
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:36,720
 You said stop with your hand, don't come with your mouth. 

814
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:37,980
 What happened? 

815
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,720
 Have you gone? 

816
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,320
 You helped, your duty is over. 

817
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,820
 If you had another duty, Osman Bey would say. 

818
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:59,620
 You put a guest, let the guest stay. 

819
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,520
 Otherwise I'll swallow you. 

820
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,220
 I am not like animals in hunting. 

821
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,660
 You looked, your gras was ripped off. 

822
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,880
 You clumsy in the ground of the soul. 

823
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,480
 Hoyt! 

824
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:31,860
 Des is! 

825
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,480
 What do you get, what do you get? 

826
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,980
 Download your swords, download! 

827
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,300
 Oy, look at those! 

828
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,640
 Especially look at those. 

829
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,920
 You are the devil in your heart. 

830
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:57,240
 Son, if the mountain leaves the mountain ... 

831
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,740
 ... if the mountain reaches the mountain, it becomes mountain. 

832
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:06,820
 I say Osman, let us light the fire of resurrection ... 

833
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,200
 ... you will be defeated by your ego! 

834
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:16,200
 Boy, you will be comrade to Osman. 

835
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,600
 That's why ... 

836
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,620
 ... first you must be a garbage. 

837
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:28,360
 Now be halal and embrace. 

838
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,820
 Embrace that your friendship will be legendary. 

839
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:39,520
 Embrace that the traitors are down! 

840
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,700
 May you halal your right. 

841
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:46,860
 You too. 

842
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,840
 This is not the case, it is not enough. 

843
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,460
 Children, As our prophet 

844
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,180
 What did he say ... 

845
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:12,640
 He said that when the real wrestler gets angry, he can dominate his ego. 

846
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:19,180
 Now let's kiss your hands like those who have erected. 

847
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,440
 Kiss so that your ego will not take you captive. 

848
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,040
 Come on, let's. 

849
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,420
 Our nafs were running low on the ground. 

850
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,760
 You've been instrumental, let's exist! 

851
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,160
 Forgive me. 

852
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,700
 You too, Samsa Sergeant, you too. 

853
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,080
 I wish my brave, maşallah. 

854
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:12,680
 Son. 

855
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:21,400
 It is always difficult to be the head and the gentleman. 

856
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,320
 For... 

857
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:47,740
 ... if the knee falls, it comes to the ground, if the head falls to the stone. 

858
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:52,580
 Plague is high, responsibility is tough. 

859
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:57,680
 In such a meal, in such badries ... 

860
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,360
 ... as a gentleman, how do the doors open? 

861
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,520
 How to enter the hearts? 

862
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,700
 If you wish to be a loving gentleman ... 

863
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:20,440
 You must take Sav, our Lord, as the Prophet. 

864
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,460
 Our master is in the middle of the desert ... 

865
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:35,080
 He established a moral civilization despite all of the tribes that were competing with each other. 

866
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:39,960
 Everyone was divided, he became a collector. 

867
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,900
 He did not bow to the persecution, nor was he afraid of the enemy. 

868
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,560
 He cried only as truth. 

869
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,480
 What was the truth? 

870
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:59,080
 La ilaha illallah Muhammad Rasulullah. 

871
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:06,240
 They tried false ways to discourage the Prophet of Mercy from his path. 

872
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,900
 But he said, "Take the Sun in one hand ... 

873
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:19,020
 ... if you give the moon to the other, I will not give up my case! '' 

874
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:25,820
 While inviting humanity to liberation in Taif, the stones wanted to stop him. 

875
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,040
 He replied mercifully. 

876
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:36,300
 In Badr, Uhud, Hendek, Küffar became horny. 

877
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:41,060
 With his bravery, he brought all the oppressors to his knees. 

878
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:47,760
 He saw it open, he covered it like night. 

879
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:53,460
 He illuminated the darkness of the era of ignorance like an oil lamp. 

880
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:59,800
 It became a light radiating from the bosom of the desert to the whole world. 

881
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:03,620
 Everybody slept, he was awake. 

882
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,540
 Everyone fell, he survived. 

883
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,420
 Everyone is tired, it was hope. 

884
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,460
 First, justice became its own. 

885
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,220
 The ointment became its own. 

886
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,820
 Acumen became his own. 

887
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,340
 Patience became his own. 

888
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,360
 You should be so son ... 

889
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:35,680
 ... justice when you walk. 

890
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,140
 Let him have mercy when you smile. 

891
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:45,000
 When you resist the persecution, you should stand patience ... 

892
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:49,200
 ... and let the people find the state. 

893
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,480
 May the light of our master be seen in that state. 

894
01:35:56,220 --> 01:36:01,900
 May my Lord allow us to be a beneficial nation to our master. 

895
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,380
 Amine. 

896
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:18,100
 (He wakes up breathless.) 

897
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,160
 My God ... 

898
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,880
 ... to me and my generation ... 

899
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:43,780
 ... will spread the spirit of our master to the world ... 

900
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,160
 ... just to start a state. 

901
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,100
 Amine. 

902
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:25,620
 What happened in Kulucahisar the night Tekfur Yorgopolos died? 

903
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:34,060
 You killed Yorgopolos. 

904
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:38,160
 He had to die to dominate the will of God. 

905
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,000
 We're not murderers, girl. 

906
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:44,660
 Side demon in hell! 

907
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:54,620
 How did you find out that I kept the sacred trust in Kulucahisar Castle of the treasures of the families? 

908
01:37:55,580 --> 01:38:01,340
 You will not learn anything from me! 

909
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:07,800
 Together with Osman Bey Edebalı, what about Eruğrul Bey? 

910
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,820
 Is he with Edebalı? 

911
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,580
 Who else is involved in this job? 

912
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:20,680
 Neither Kayı nor Osman Bey know anything. 

913
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,580
 The night you died Tekfur ... 

914
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:30,940
 ... to track down the killer of your blood brother ... 

915
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,540
 He came to Tekfur. 

916
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:41,380
 Be skin girl. 

917
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,980
 Relax relax. 

918
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,100
 Kerem and Aslı. 

919
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:06,320
 You are fluttering to keep Osman away from a demon like me. 

920
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,240
 I see fear in her eyes, not for yourself, but for her. 

921
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:18,020
 He cries that beautiful eyes fall in love with Osman Bey. 

922
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,160
 Surprise old man! 

923
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:27,660
 I'm telling you the truth. 

924
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,940
 Osman Bey does not know our secret. 

925
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,520
 I said he doesn't know! 

926
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,760
 Osman means that he got involved without knowing it. 

927
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,340
 It doesn't matter sooner or later he will also die. 

928
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:53,060
 The alps in his obek and all the Turks who have occupied our land will die. 

929
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,200
 As for you ... 

930
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:02,580
 ... your life is in my hands, Bala. 

931
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:10,640
 Now you will tell me where the sacred relic and the treasure are. 

932
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:18,360
 Death is salvation for us. 

933
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:26,540
 Shahada is a hit for us. 

934
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:28,680
 (Yells with pain.) 

935
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,320
 I'm patient, Bala. 

936
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,260
 I will watch it melt in front of my eyes. 

937
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,780
 You will see that no secret can be hidden from me. 

938
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,300
 (It is complaining.) 

939
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
 (He starts reading Surab Tebbet in Arabic.) 

940
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,480
 What did he say, sir? 

941
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,540
 He read Surah Tebbet. 

942
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,140
 In the name of Allah, the most gracious and womb. 

943
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,180
 Abu Leheb's hands are dry, he's already dry. 

944
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:21,280
 He neither benefited him or won. 

945
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,760
 He will enter a flaming fire. 

946
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:31,680
 Although there is a string of palm fibers twisted around his neck, his wife will enter the fire by carrying wood on his back. 

947
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:36,560
 Megala will not protect her from her poison! He will talk sooner. 

948
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:18,220
 Sir. 

949
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,220
 They broke your yarens. 

950
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,740
 We were exhausted at these ends. 

951
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:28,640
 [Door opens.] 

952
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,540
 [The door closes.] 

953
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:43,740
 Sir. 

954
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:48,620
 Bala Hatun ... 

955
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,060
 ... they kidnapped him. 

956
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:00,680
 My daughter. 

957
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,580
 Gonca Hatun was injured. 

958
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:09,440
 Dündar Bey took him to Kayı Obası for treatment. 

959
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,720
 Yarenler ... 

960
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,200
 Do not count with the finger ... 

961
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,440
 ... with breaking perfection! 

962
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:36,520
 May a thousand children be sacrificed, not a son in the way of order. 

963
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:55,480
 Abraham in the fire, Ismail in front of the knife ... 

964
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,340
 ... Yusuf in the wells, Yunus in the seas ... 

965
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:04,820
 ... and my lord in the cave protecting the truth. 

966
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,060
 You keep our secret. 

967
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:13,680
 Keep my daughter's head upright against them. 

968
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:16,740
 Give him the strength to endure. 

969
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:25,400
 Ask him about the mind of Aisha, and the joy of Hz. 

970
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:29,720
 ... give the patience of Hz. 

971
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,280
 Make us tough and imposing against the pan. 

972
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:41,160
 Curve our pusat, bite our horses. 

973
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:49,300
 Our heroes are mansur and victorious, their enemy is graceful and defeated. 

974
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,080
 Surely victory belongs only to you. 

975
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,760
 My coyote was trapped. 

976
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,660
 The place to go informally is clear. 

977
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:44,720
 Where are they? 

978
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,160
 They're in the direction of Nikea, sir. 

979
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:48,320
 Come on God! 

980
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:50,960
 (They always shout Allah as an idiot.) 

981
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,280
 Takbir Allah! 

982
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,220
 Come easy. 

983
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,100
 Hayrola sir? 

984
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:32,240
 What would a dervish like you do with a dagger and pusat? 

985
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,760
 Carrying iron with temper is circumcised. 

986
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,180
 We hug the sunnah, sir. 

987
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,040
 Thank you. 

988
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:45,160
 Since Ertuğrul Bey went to Konya ... 

989
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,220
 ... there is no peace in extreme lands. 

990
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:52,400
 News of bandits that hit caravans and bandits that hit the market every day. 

991
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:57,200
 You spoke truthfully, dervish, there is no peace here. 

992
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,300
 They also raided the new market by the lake. 

993
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:06,400
 We heard that they had everyone sword, is there any truth? 

994
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:10,500
 It is true, the dervish master is correct. It is not clear who they are. 

995
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:12,660
 They killed everyone. 

996
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,920
 Didn't they put anyone alive? 

997
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,800
 Only one girl was injured. 

998
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:21,080
 Dundar Bey also brought him to goodness for good. 

999
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,840
 How was your chick? 

1000
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:29,880
 She is in the hospital, Zöhre hat is concerned. 

1001
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:35,520
 I hope it will be good. But why did you ask? 

1002
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:41,120
 Healing is from Allah, but let's pray for a breath. 

1003
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,100
 (He says quietly, "O Allah!") 

1004
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:24,900
 What does he say, sir? 

1005
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,060
 (Laughs.) 

1006
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:32,100
 He is looking for healing in Allah. 

1007
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:42,520
 However, his healing is in my hands. 

1008
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:44,340
 (Laughs.) 

1009
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:46,340
 (Laughs.) 

1010
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:56,160
 Ya shafi, ya Allah! 

1011
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:04,100
 (They hit the drum.) 

1012
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:09,660
 [Thriller music] 

1013
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,380
 (They always shout out, "What are they doing here?") 

1014
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,480
 Get out of here! 

1015
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,700
 What are you doing here! 

1016
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:45,420
 If you were a messenger before, we would know that we would not welcome you like this. 

1017
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:50,960
 Alişar Bey, we collected sherbet like a lake and meat like a mountain. 

1018
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:54,300
 Is there anybody who doesn't know the abundance of Kayı table, Dündar? 

1019
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:59,580
 We came not in the hope of feast, but in the hope of conversation. 

1020
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,580
 If you came for a conversation, you came quite crowded. 

1021
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:24,340
 However, our heart is enough for everyone. 

1022
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,520
 You are informal. 

1023
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,200
 Princess Sofia sent the priest, sir. 

1024
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,280
 What do you want from me? 

1025
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,040
 Who is this girl? 

1026
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:11,120
 I want you to forgive this nun's life, priestly rout. 

1027
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:16,820
 Which nun? 

1028
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:22,240
 Look at your face. Look, will you know me? 

1029
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,720
 One of the two nuns walking around with you in the castle. 

1030
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,620
 Look! 

1031
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:31,740
 This is a Turkish girl. 

1032
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,840
 What nun? 

1033
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:36,220
 What are you up to? 

1034
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:41,460
 Let me know if this girl is going to die. 

1035
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,460
 Isn't he Turkish? 

1036
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,980
 Leave me in the name of God! 

1037
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:49,100
 Save yourself from a great sin! 

1038
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,600
 What did you give that girl? 

1039
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:10,140
 Poison. 

1040
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,680
 What are you doing? 

1041
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,080
 Medicine to tell us everything he knows. 

1042
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:27,340
 If he does not speak and speak, a slow and painful death awaits him! 

1043
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,680
 God forgive the sins of this girl. 

1044
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:40,300
 If you are not willing to die, you will tell us the location of Edebalı's treasure! 

1045
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:46,520
 I also have healing that will remove the poison from your body. 

1046
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:55,920
 If you give me what I want, I'll let you both live. So you forgive him. 

1047
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,800
 Who are you? 

1048
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:02,100
 The monk Yannis from the Margarit Monastery. 

1049
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:45,440
 My Alps took security, and when they point, they will raid. 

1050
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:50,960
 If we raid, they kill Bala Hatun or Tursun. 

1051
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,880
 Son, what's in your mind? 

1052
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,140
 Both Bala Hatun and Tursun are inside. 

1053
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:09,640
 We need to infiltrate to prevent them from happening. 

1054
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,040
 (They hit.) 

1055
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:25,420
 Lets! 

1056
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:09,200
 Say now ... 

1057
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:15,300
 ... what brings you all to Kayı Obası? 

1058
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,560
 Adalat Dündar Bey. 

1059
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:26,460
 In order not to break the ties between us and to wear down the friendship established with you ... 

1060
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,440
 ... a friendly visit. 

1061
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:40,700
 There are many issues that open up to us and harm our good relations, Dündar Bey. 

1062
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:47,860
 Isn't it one of them that my daughter was kidnapped and brought to your castle? 

1063
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:49,320
 Of course it is. 

1064
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:53,460
 Nobody would want such a thing to happen. 

1065
01:59:55,180 --> 02:00:00,120
 But remember, the knot in the middle of all ties ... 

1066
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,500
 ... in Osman's hands. 

1067
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:15,840
 Our intention is to settle the matter without giving way to a bloody war, Dundar Bey. 

1068
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:25,040
 Under the supervision of Sancak Bey Alişar Bey, we want to face Osman and ask our questions. 

1069
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,420
 This is the most acceptable. 

1070
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:35,720
 We will not give opportunity to those who want to intervene and burn the fitna fire. 

1071
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,060
 Call Osman to come. 

1072
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:47,860
 There is no Osman. 

1073
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,260
 What does it mean! 

1074
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,180
 You told me you were in a caged tent. 

1075
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:02,020
 He had a hostility with Batur last ... 

1076
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,820
 ... I commanded it and threw it into the caged tent. 

1077
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:09,240
 However, he escaped from there. 

1078
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:20,480
 How can you not hold a criminal who has been charged so much, Gündüz Bey? 

1079
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,460
 How can he escape when this alp is up to you? 

1080
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:37,540
 Whatever he escaped from the dungeon of your castle under your command, Kalanoz! 

1081
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:41,140
 It is obvious that you miss Osman without confrontation! 

1082
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:46,080
 Are you playing games for us? This is the reason for war, Dundar Bey! 

1083
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:55,800
 Calanosis is blown into our ears before we are born when we are born. 

1084
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,920
 Fear of war is namert! 

1085
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,520
 (Screams.) 

1086
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:21,940
 (He whines with pain.) 

1087
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:30,180
 How could a monk in the way of God like you be so brutal Yannis? 

1088
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,420
 I beg you leave me! 

1089
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:36,120
 I'm pastor Marcus. 

1090
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:42,720
 Find out who I am from the Metropolitan, everyone knows me. 

1091
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,100
 I'm pastor Marcus. 

1092
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:49,820
 (She screams with vengeance.) 

1093
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:52,380
 (They scream.) 

1094
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:53,340
 Enough! 

1095
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,840
 Enough! 

1096
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:57,640
 (They scream.) 

1097
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:58,560
 Megale! 

1098
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
 It means you have decided to speak. 

1099
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,180
 Kill him, I don't even care. 

1100
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:17,840
 Kill me too, it's over! 

1101
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:25,260
 I don't know where the sacred trust is. 

1102
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:33,080
 Only my father knows this. 

1103
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:49,840
 Maybe his language is deciphered as you die. 

1104
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:59,500
 (Breathe with difficulty.) 

1105
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,720
 God give me the strength to bear. 

1106
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:09,740
 (Choking.) 

1107
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:24,660
 Bala Hatun! 

1108
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:31,800
 (She's barely breathing.) 

1109
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:35,420
 Bala Hatun huh? 

1110
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:43,060
 It turned out who you are priest rout. 

1111
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:48,180
 Or should I call you Edebalı's spy? 

1112
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:51,420
 You're a demon, Yannis! 

1113
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,880
 We do not know the place of the sacred trust. 

1114
02:04:57,300 --> 02:05:00,520
 You will never learn what we do not know from us! 

1115
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:06,980
 You will not be able to prevent the divinity of the divine word! 

1116
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:14,360
 You will not be able to prevent the awakening of the Turks and the knuckle of the establishment! 

1117
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:19,900
 The wooden sword will find its owner. 

1118
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:24,720
 That day will be the day you end! 

1119
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,740
 Allahu Akbar! 

1120
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:34,560
 Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! 

1121
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:55,980
 Come on, children, it's time. 

1122
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:57,480
 We are always ready, sir. 

1123
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:12,360
 There is raid, there is raid! 

1124
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:15,280
 Come on, valiant, you will vomit blood! 

1125
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:16,400
 Come on God! 

1126
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:18,200
 (They scream with anger.) 

1127
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:03,880
 Samsa Sergeant, Bamsı Bey from that side. 

1128
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:13,060
 Osman is coming! 

1129
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:14,940
 Osman is coming! 

1130
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:25,700
 Damn it! 

1131
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:27,240
 Sir, what are we going to do? 

1132
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,520
 Osman... 

1133
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:43,440
 [Thriller music] 

1134
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:57,900
 Come with me Megalon. 

1135
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,640
 Bala. 

1136
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:26,420
 Bala. 

1137
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:47,700
 Bala, Bala! 

1138
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:50,360
 Bala, no! 

1139
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:53,660
 No no! 

1140
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:57,940
 Bala, Bala open your eyes. 

1141
02:09:58,900 --> 02:09:59,880
 I came. 

1142
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:01,800
 I'm with you. 

1143
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,320
 Tursun, Tursun! 

1144
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:14,580
 Thank goodness he lives. 

1145
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:39,060
 Bala Beyun, daughter of Osman Bey Edebalı, in three days ... 

1146
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:42,560
 ... will slowly die in pain. 

1147
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:50,060
 I have only one healing her. 

1148
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,300
 If you want to save him ... 

1149
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,600
 ... give me back what you stole from me. 

1150
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:01,040
 Master Yannis. 

1151
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:03,900
 [Lightning sound.] 

1152
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,500
 Bala, Bala! 

1153
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:24,480
 Open your eyes, open it. 

1154
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,960
 Let your heart pierce my heart. 

1155
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,640
 Let it break my life. 

1156
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:39,620
 As long as you open your beautiful eyes. 

1157
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,680
 Bala. 

1158
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:50,660
 Bala. 

1159
02:11:58,760 --> 02:11:59,840
 Osman. 

1160
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:00,680
 Bala. 

1161
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:06,200
 You came for me. 

1162
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:11,000
 Oh, I came for you. 

1163
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:15,420
 You know I won't take you out of my life again. 

1164
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:19,560
 You know ... 

1165
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:25,420
 ... it's too late. 

1166
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:33,060
 Yannis's poison is in my blood. 

1167
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:46,100
 That Yannis ... 

1168
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:50,280
 ... I'll find it if it goes seven times below ground. 

1169
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:53,460
 I will come to you with healing. 

1170
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:02,360
 No, don't do it. 

1171
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,320
 Do not! 

1172
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:12,700
 You are the hope of these extreme lands, Osman. 

1173
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:18,580
 Not worth for a Bala. 

1174
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:26,820
 I burn Kulucahisar, not the whole world, but all the world! 

1175
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:32,240
 I will find your healing and come. 

1176
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:37,180
 Do not surrender, think of your father. 

1177
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,280
 Think of your Ahi friends. 

1178
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,480
 If I have a breath of bliss, let it be wind for sake. 

1179
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:50,680
 Do not surrender. 

1180
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:54,900
 Don't surrender! 

1181
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:02,760
 Halal your right, Osman! 

1182
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:04,960
 Bala! 

1183
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:12,840
 Bala! Bala! Bala! 

1184
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:15,400
 Bala open your eyes, Bala! 

1185
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,080
 (They yell angrily.) 

1186
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:49,960
 Oh thank goodness. 

1187
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:52,680
 Thank goodness he lives. 

1188
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:08,040
 He becomes old when he is halfway through. 

1189
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,360
 It would be Bahtiyar. 

1190
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:15,300
 Be entrusted to Allah, salute. 

1191
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:18,880
 I never watched this man know this. 

1192
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:23,380
 Neither does he abandon his treacherous traitor, nor his cruel cruelty. 

1193
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:26,040
 As long as we are about to become a mutant. 

1194
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,960
 You will prepare a thesis sled for Bala Hatun and Tursun. 

1195
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,920
 Take it to my father's car. 

1196
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,520
 Bala Hatun Ayşe is entrusted to aunt. 

1197
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:06,620
 You should be well aware, do whatever it takes. 

1198
02:16:06,620 --> 02:16:07,980
 My command, my head, sir. 

1199
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:13,460
 They poisoned Bala Hatun. 

1200
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,180
 Bloodless dogs 

1201
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:17,160
 They have healing. 

1202
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:20,300
 What do they want, sir? 

1203
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:25,220
 We will go to take, not give! 

1204
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:27,220
 [Lightning sound] 

1205
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:33,880
 In contrast to the life of Bala Hatun, Sofia's life. 

1206
02:17:01,320 --> 02:18:41,580
 [Generic music] 

1207
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:46,420
 [Wolf howls.]

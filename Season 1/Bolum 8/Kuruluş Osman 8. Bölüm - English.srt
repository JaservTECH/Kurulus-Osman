1
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
 God is with those who are patient. 

2
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Is there a destur, son? 

3
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,860
 I want to be alone, aunt. 

4
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,540
 Isn't he alone in everybody who can't get his love, son? 

5
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,920
 What difference does it make if I have been? 

6
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,560
 As he thinks, a weight falls on the floor, aunt. 

7
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 Why doesn't he see your daughter? 

8
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,520
 What did I get wrong and it wouldn't replace me? 

9
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,500
 It's not about manhood, son ... 

10
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,680
 Sheikh, one of the people who know your manners best. 

11
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,700
 The main thing now is what you will do. 

12
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,860
 Will you fall in the palm of your anger ... 

13
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,620
 Or are you mindful to act? 

14
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 This is the issue. 

15
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
 As the winter will be tough. 

16
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,760
 We have to work hard 

17
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
 It is necessary to observe the right of the fair. 

18
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,420
 The pockets that we will distribute to the intention of charity ... 

19
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,880
 Let's also prepare the caps and wedges. 

20
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
 Don't worry don't worry 

21
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
 There is no burn that appears .. 

22
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
 However, the fire is deep. 

23
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,320
 There is no in those who are not in the area. 

24
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,180
 The point is to have wisdom in this decision of my Sheikh. 

25
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,580
 I don't know the reason for this decision either. 

26
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,580
 All I know is that my heart beats for Osman. 

27
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,640
 Waiting for me is to wait for my life. 

28
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 Patience iron roasted chickpeas 

29
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,980
 Osman I expect is counting this from grace. 

30
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,960
 In my opinion, Osman Bey, your opinion does not take long to wait. 

31
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
 He will find a way. 

32
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
 Heart pain was weird 

33
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,020
 As it snows on me, it feels like a fire falls on me. 

34
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,020
 I do not know if I am a brochure or burn. 

35
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,160
 However, the answer to the questions is in my father. 

36
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
 I will go and talk to him. 

37
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
 Welcome girl. 

38
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,220
 Goodbye dad 

39
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,520
 I thought you were hungry at night. 

40
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,260
 You did well. 

41
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,020
 Good health honey. 

42
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,160
 It is important to know the time, my daughter. 

43
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,220
 In this land in the winter ... 

44
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,560
 White flowers on almond trees ... 

45
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,560
 They think it is spring, they will open it, girl. 

46
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
 To the false light of the sun ... 

47
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,500
 They are deceived by the warmness surrounding their branches. 

48
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 Since they did not open on time ... 

49
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,880
 The cold of the night falls to its shareholders. 

50
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,280
 Time is important for my heart, my daughter ... 

51
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
 You have those fresh leaves ... 

52
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,500
 The essence of what I say with a thousand labor ... 

53
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 Avoid the winter sun ... 

54
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,180
 Do not be afraid of your zinn ... 

55
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
 Do not roast your flowers. 

56
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,060
 There is no consent to meet with Osman. 

57
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
 You know. 

58
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,560
 What happened, Bala? 

59
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 What is this state? 

60
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,980
 My father 

61
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
 He does not want me to meet with Osman. 

62
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,260
 Gonca has finished this matter in his mind. 

63
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,040
 Once upon a time with a beautiful girl ... 

64
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,720
 There was a young man around. 

65
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,040
 My Lord compared them with a gazelle. 

66
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,540
 The first moment they see each other ... 

67
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
 The fire of love fell on their hearts. 

68
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
 Which one should I tell, son? 

69
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
 They fought hard challenges. 

70
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,940
 But they never gave up on their love. 

71
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
 That love came to life. 

72
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,300
 He came to life with three brave men like a lion. 

73
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
 The day prosecutor ... 

74
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 Brother pattern ... 

75
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,220
 Now you drop face like this ... 

76
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
 If you are devastated by gam's hand ... 

77
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
 Does it ever happen? 

78
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 My heart is a warlord. 

79
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,900
 I cant stop at the few things I like. 

80
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
 Not if I say anger ... 

81
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,380
 Not if I say ambition ... 

82
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,160
 Not that... 

83
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,860
 Not meeting me makes me crazy. 

84
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,820
 lord 

85
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,480
 The fire inside you hits my heart. 

86
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,020
 I couldn't stop in the tent. 

87
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,520
 I came to you. 

88
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,860
 Come on let's get winged, sir. 

89
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
 Since he has a heart in you too ... 

90
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
 Let's go and kidnap Bal Hatun, sir. 

91
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,680
 I like the chaos but this time everything is very confused ... 

92
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,040
 In this chaos, the most difficult task is Sophia. 

93
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,400
 As long as our ideals win, dad. 

94
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,860
 It will come from the right of the coast without using weapons ... 

95
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,680
 The only power is Alişar. 

96
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,060
 Therefore, his alliance is important. 

97
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
 Look no further, sir. 

98
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
 It is understood that you want to say. 

99
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
 In the water supplier ... 

100
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 May you pour water too. 

101
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 In your life ... 

102
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 I respect you, son. 

103
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 May my father accept God. 

104
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
 Is there a problem in Oba, Yaman? 

105
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,900
 Ahval is subject, sir, but ... 

106
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 There was news in my ear at night. 

107
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
 You stay in place like an owl, but ... 

108
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,240
 Nothing escapes your eyes. 

109
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
 For Osman Bey Edebalı to want his daughter ... 

110
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
 He sent Selcan Hatun to the wedding. 

111
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
 What is the ultimate? 

112
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
 He said it is not necessary. 

113
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
 He cut it off. 

114
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
 Oba sir instead of sucking ... 

115
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,740
 If you send your aunt as a wedding man ... 

116
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
 This is what it will be. 

117
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,120
 Now Osman is on his own. 

118
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
 Come 

119
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
 In the morning prayer time ... 

120
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,260
 Is it no? 

121
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,140
 News of a caravan across the border came. 

122
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,640
 In my opinion, out of Nike, he goes to Kulucahisar. 

123
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,020
 It comes after good news. 

124
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,900
 Is it installed? 

125
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
 Also from horse carriages 

126
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,120
 So they try to hide from us, but ... 

127
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 They switched to Cenk order. 

128
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,040
 Do you think they are getting ready, sir? 

129
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,260
 Sneakily. 

130
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
 Here they laugh at our face ... 

131
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,540
 From there they prepare for war. 

132
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,240
 What's your order? 

133
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,260
 Everyone reveals his pusat. 

134
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
 We will do so. 

135
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
 Or are we going to attack the castle, sir? 

136
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,520
 No 

137
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
 Not now 

138
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
 First, the shroud of the shroud raided that caravan ... 

139
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
 We will leave the castle breathless for a while. 

140
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,680
 Dündar Bey forgot the bellies ... 

141
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,540
 But they don't know, I don't forget anything. 

142
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
 The kidnapping of my daughter ... 

143
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
 The torture of Osman was also ... 

144
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
 They will pay the price. 

145
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,820
 Let me inform Osman so that they can prepare. 

146
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,740
 No 

147
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 Not necessary. 

148
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
 This is my lion ... 

149
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
 Batur will handle it. 

150
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,800
 For some reason, we do not make such a raid. 

151
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,120
 Now go teach them who is Baturalp, the son of Dundar Bey. 

152
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
 Bring your loot ... 

153
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
 May his eyes look brave. 

154
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
 This is yours, sir. 

155
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
 It was unambiguously obvious ... 

156
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,580
 In Kulucahisar without destroying mischief ... 

157
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
 There is no peace in this land. 

158
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,140
 Are we going to migrate? 

159
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,620
 Unlike... 

160
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,560
 We will record this place, Zülfikar. 

161
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,800
 But we will clearly fight. 

162
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,320
 To hold on the edge is difficult ... 

163
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
 Want tough allies. 

164
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,020
 Mr. Alişar, starboard ... 

165
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
 In the mongolian tasalut ... 

166
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,920
 He is the man of Konya. 

167
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
 In the absence of Ertuğurul Bey ... 

168
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
 Dündar Bey does not tend to us. 

169
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
 If we say Osman ... 

170
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,520
 We did not give our daughter to Osman either. 

171
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,680
 Do not you think who we will do this work with? 

172
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
 I didn't have a tongue, sir. 

173
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
 You fully acted our absence. 

174
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
 We do not be grateful for anyone. 

175
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,940
 It is the body that gives the rizq. 

176
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,800
 So we will settle in the New Market. 

177
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,260
 It's stronger and more robust. 

178
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,380
 We will breathe believers with our guilt. 

179
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 To Tekeli, Konya, 

180
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,840
 To Alayi and Kayseri ... 

181
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,260
 Let me know. 

182
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,420
 Let the sentence dear. 

183
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,640
 Our comrades who carry ahi knuckles in their hearts ... 

184
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
 Let them be on the road. 

185
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,820
 To these extreme lands covered by weeds ... 

186
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,040
 It is time to plant the faith roses. 

187
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
 Do you see the silk? 

188
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,960
 It suits my man. 

189
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,860
 It is the same as in the palace. 

190
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,080
 Alişar Bey's mansion is also no different from the palace. 

191
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
 Did you order it? 

192
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,620
 It is true sir 

193
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
 Why does your face sell vinegar? 

194
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,020
 Ahval at your borders is not good at all. 

195
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
 How about you man? 

196
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
 What does that mean? 

197
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
 While you were in Konya ... 

198
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,780
 The issue of Osman and Kulucahisar flared up, sir. 

199
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,920
 You think I'd collect news for yourself. 

200
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
 I know what Osman is doing. 

201
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
 I am aware of the beyond. 

202
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
 Osman's alps died. 

203
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,980
 Its purpose is clear. 

204
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,500
 Getting the head of Sophia and Kalanoz. 

205
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,980
 Sophia wants to visit you in your mansion. 

206
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,540
 Obviously this is the subject. 

207
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,420
 I like silk and flowers. 

208
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,760
 Let the princess come to you. 

209
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
 I smelled like a goat from dealing with these. 

210
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940
 Overbearing 

211
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
 Get the bath ready 

212
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,340
 Because of this matter of heart ... 

213
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,280
 Don't be offended. 

214
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
 It does not suit er person. 

215
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,640
 It is not just a matter of heart. 

216
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,520
 child 

217
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,020
 Then say it to me. 

218
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,880
 Sheikh literary 

219
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
 I'll come to your door beyond ... 

220
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
 He does not deserve to speak. 

221
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
 child 

222
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,640
 Şeyh Edebalı is the great person. 

223
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,240
 With the great person, the race is tough. 

224
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,780
 There is a wisdom. 

225
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,920
 Kid, open your eyes, it is not time to distribute efkar. 

226
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,500
 A caravan comes from Nikela to Kulucahisar ... 

227
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,060
 They understood that they were stuck in the corner. 

228
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
 The children understood and understood ... 

229
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,780
 Dündar Bey commissioned Batur for the raid. 

230
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
 Obviously he wants to shine the star of Batur. 

231
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,240
 It does the right thing. 

232
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
 It is even late. 

233
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
 Evelallah Batur will do what is necessary. 

234
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,840
 When Alişar stands in front of him, he must know how to stay firm. 

235
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,520
 Alişar Bey returned from Konya. 

236
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,820
 Thank you Boran. 

237
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
 Beyim is also a literary ... 

238
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
 It settles in Yeni Pazar with its yarens. 

239
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
 My mister is just in time. 

240
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,740
 Let's glide and glide. 

241
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,380
 If you keep an eye on Alişar's mansion. 

242
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,180
 I will know what is going. 

243
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,760
 This is yours, sir. 

244
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
 I go to the New Market. 

245
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
 Oba is entrusted to you. 

246
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
 Thank you, Osman. 

247
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,020
 No, Aygül? 

248
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
 Did the shadow fall on their rugs? 

249
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
 Why would you use such dark colors? 

250
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,980
 May the loads on our back be lightened ... 

251
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,360
 I hope it will bloom white flowers in our rugs. 

252
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,100
 Have we been humped on your back, Zöhre? 

253
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
 Clearly, do not defraud. 

254
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,100
 You can protrude like a rug, 

255
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,360
 I do not mean to you Selcan Hatun. 

256
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 Calm down 

257
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,880
 Who is then? 

258
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
 Who is the load on your back? 

259
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,540
 The burden is not mine. 

260
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
 Selcan Hatun is on our back. 

261
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,740
 Since the literary came, there has been a duality in the oba. 

262
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,520
 Not the arrival of a friend of God ... 

263
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,600
 Take off because of what you see yourself in the giant mirror. 

264
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
 Look, look. 

265
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
 Both your eyes are blind ... 

266
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,620
 Also, our ceremony was gone. 

267
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,720
 While he was waiting for his son to ask for a girl ... 

268
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,340
 Is his aunt going to work? 

269
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
 Regarding Osman's state ... 

270
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
 You came back from the door. 

271
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
 If you try to do more than your height ... 

272
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,080
 It happens like this. 

273
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
 You say son, son ... 

274
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,300
 I say I'm a child. 

275
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,140
 Boy, if he wants anything from me, I will go no matter what. 

276
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,740
 It is true that the Sheikh did not give his daughter. 

277
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,100
 It is true, my Osman is in trouble ... 

278
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,740
 But what you call Yiğit ... 

279
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,000
 Burn with trouble, cook with love. 

280
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
 I know my brain's gras. 

281
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
 He will not give up. 

282
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
 I burn to the labor of his father. 

283
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
 What was that? 

284
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,060
 While the son of Koskoca Ertuğurul Gazi is running after the avrat ... 

285
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,420
 My Batur raids Kefer on his caravan. 

286
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
 They didn't say it in vain ... 

287
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
 Yigit is evident in the square. 

288
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
 You will pay the price of this very heavily. 

289
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,140
 The informal sentence is pusat, commander. 

290
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,500
 We will not stop until your stone remains breathless in your castle. 

291
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,360
 You know. 

292
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
 Now you go ... 

293
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,300
 If you are asking, you say Batur confiscated the caravan. 

294
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,100
 Put the gold jewelery separately. 

295
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,480
 Thank you Baturalp. 

296
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,700
 My brothers... 

297
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,320
 It's been a long time ... 

298
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
 We do not hit the caravan on the shroud. 

299
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
 From now on... 

300
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,580
 The fire that came from the purists of our catwalk ... 

301
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,280
 They will feel on their nape. 

302
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,580
 We will be without an apache like Ecel. 

303
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,620
 Allahuekber 

304
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
 Allahuekber 

305
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
 Long live our Dundar Bey! 

306
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,980
 What's up ? 

307
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,300
 What is this crowd like? 

308
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
 We wait for Sheikh Edebalı. 

309
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
 Thanks. 

310
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
 Mr. Bey, it's time to run around. 

311
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,420
 You look around. 

312
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,180
 I have the rest. 

313
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,360
 Souls ... 

314
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,840
 My competitors pay tribute to my Sheikh ... 

315
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
 My name is Edebalı. 

316
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,800
 Wearing the belt of effort and saying the prophet profession ... 

317
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
 We came to trade. 

318
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,660
 My comrades are called ahi. 

319
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
 Many of my brothers are on their way. 

320
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,720
 We are ... 

321
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,700
 Your short litter ... 

322
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
 He will take the right from the long garbage ... 

323
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 We believe in the account day. 

324
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
 That's why our aim is ... 

325
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,260
 It is justice in weighing and calculation. 

326
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
 We wish ... 

327
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
 Keep the order of the market. 

328
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
 We would like ... 

329
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,600
 Not the strong ... 

330
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
 Let the judge pass the judgment. 

331
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
 Let the poor fukara be full of stomach ... 

332
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
 Give it to what is not happening. 

333
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
 Folks! 

334
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
 Get the good of the goods cheaper ... 

335
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,300
 Eat cheap. 

336
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,180
 We will keep this market unofficial from this. 

337
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,620
 Good luck to everyone. 

338
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,660
 Princess. 

339
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
 In order for our beautiful eyes to feast ... 

340
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
 I decorated the places you printed with carpets. 

341
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,780
 Welcome to my mansion. 

342
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,520
 You Mansion ... 

343
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,120
 As legendary as they say. 

344
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,580
 It used to be a mansion. 

345
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,820
 A princess like you became a palace when you step on foot. 

346
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,000
 I spilled roses on your paths. 

347
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,120
 A kind of flower princess in roses. 

348
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,340
 Here, Osman Bey. 

349
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
 What do you want from me ? 

350
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,740
 Is it Murad? 

351
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
 Or a breath? 

352
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
 Of course I could. 

353
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
 What if I don't give up? 

354
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,860
 In that case... 

355
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,380
 I wait on the brink. 

356
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,380
 I'll keep your time. 

357
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
 Waiting on the threshold ... 

358
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,260
 Osman Bey is a trick to the dervishes. 

359
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
 Patience will crack ... 

360
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
 Your mind bridge collapses ... 

361
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,840
 You can not stand. 

362
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,080
 Wait... 

363
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
 Ham Adam ... 

364
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,820
 Toy Yiğit is not a business. 

365
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,020
 Wait... 

366
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
 Not an opponent ... 

367
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,280
 It is the work of wrestlers who defeat their nafs. 

368
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,060
 You go up to the square and take a nape. 

369
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
 Wrestling on this patience cushion ... 

370
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,940
 Osman Bey is not your fee. 

371
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,860
 I wrestled a lot ... 

372
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
 I hit a lot ... 

373
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,420
 I've never been defeated. 

374
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,360
 Not that... 

375
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
 Now my back is on the ground. 

376
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,480
 Thank you. 

377
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,640
 My favorite fragrance. 

378
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,460
 Jasmine. 

379
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,140
 It doesn't look good on everyone's skin. 

380
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,940
 You can understand the scents well. 

381
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,920
 Let's see. 

382
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,380
 Does it suit me? 

383
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,900
 What do you want, Sophia? 

384
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
 We love the same things as you ... 

385
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,860
 The smell of flowers and the sound of gold. 

386
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
 I have both. 

387
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,580
 Are you on the side of Osman and Edebalı ... 

388
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
 Is it with the things you love? 

389
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,940
 What is the Ottoman subject? 

390
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,440
 Tell me first. 

391
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,880
 Osman I don't even care. 

392
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,900
 Without Osman ... 

393
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
 We were going to do what the Mongols failed. 

394
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,040
 We were going to stop Edebalı. 

395
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,340
 What is your problem with literary? 

396
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,700
 What kind of thing is literary for you ... 

397
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,280
 When he settled in this land ... 

398
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,200
 It will be a matter for me. 

399
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,160
 Alişar Bey 

400
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,860
 What I want from you is stopping Edebalı. 

401
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,940
 If we go hand in hand, we hold the fire together. 

402
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,520
 We defeat from our lands. 

403
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,120
 Our friendship of Edebalı .... 

404
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
 Don't let it poison. 

405
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,780
 How am I going to trust you Sophia? 

406
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,460
 What is it, Bully? 

407
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,800
 Sir 

408
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,620
 Batur raided the caravan from Byzantium. 

409
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,040
 He killed the soldiers and in the Byzantine territory. 

410
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,120
 Damn it. 

411
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,420
 His fire spread to my land. 

412
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,860
 Don't you see? 

413
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,460
 You saw too Alişar Bey 

414
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,280
 Edebalı first poisoned Osman and now Dündar Bey. 

415
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,180
 You still question how to trust me? 

416
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,720
 I said I would say. 

417
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,220
 If the tax you pay falls ... 

418
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,940
 They don't keep you here. 

419
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,340
 Not the shadow of the sultan ... 

420
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,520
 You paw on the Mongols' boots. 

421
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
 Alişar Bey. 

422
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,100
 Princess! 

423
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,300
 Wait for me tonight ... 

424
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,880
 I Will visit you. 

425
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,920
 Why would you turn to me, Bala? 

426
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,720
 Allah knows... 

427
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,940
 You know ... 

428
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
 I made a promise to you ... 

429
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,640
 I live on that word, Osman. 

430
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,540
 But my father's word is above my word. 

431
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,460
 If he doesn't see it, I can't chew. 

432
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,740
 Don't come again 

433
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,620
 How about you? 

434
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
 Before I look at this face ... 

435
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,820
 How do I live without seeing these eyes? 

436
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,880
 I entrust my heart to you. 

437
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,880
 I'm here if you own it. 

438
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
 If you give up ... 

439
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,880
 Let me know how to put a heart. 

440
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,260
 Then... 

441
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,300
 This is Kara Osman's word ... 

442
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
 You understand well ... 

443
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,140
 Whatever direction you go ... 

444
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,740
 I'm behind you too. 

445
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,180
 I swear. 

446
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
 When you say be ... 

447
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
 Filling our hearts with the spirit of faith ... 

448
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,280
 With the name 99 of Allah Almighty. 

449
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
 I know if I read it ... 

450
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,020
 You wonder the purpose of gathering you here. 

451
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,220
 Wonder what word Dündar Bey ... 

452
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,720
 The cruelty that Ulucahisar made was obvious. 

453
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,160
 We have sharpened our pusat and we expect the news of the war to come from you. 

454
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,340
 Mr. Sansa says right, it's time to fight. 

455
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,920
 Both the enemy and the antagonist are evident. 

456
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
 Samsa sergeant speaks well. 

457
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,540
 Dundar Bey is the time to fight. 

458
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,740
 Mr. Bamsı ... 

459
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,140
 Samsa sergeant ... 

460
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,840
 How do I know if it boils into your blood ... 

461
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,520
 If you want to see your soul, you want to see your booty ... 

462
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,200
 So let me show you. 

463
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,300
 Baturalp 

464
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,700
 Press Reset. 

465
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,080
 What are these, Dundar Bey? 

466
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
 Baturalp the ... 

467
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,620
 It is the spoils he brought with his claw. 

468
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,440
 My lion son ... 

469
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,180
 How to print a caravan on the voyage ... 

470
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,060
 The sentence showed the world. 

471
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,480
 Just like he saved Osman ... 

472
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,600
 He made another excitement. 

473
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,100
 Speaking of Osman ... 

474
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
 Why don't we have Osman Bey? 

475
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
 Or is he not invited to our toy? 

476
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,720
 Osman Oba is not Demirci. 

477
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,780
 He's got a job. 

478
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,720
 Daytime gentleman could not fully explain. 

479
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,000
 Osman Bey has more important works ... 

480
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,520
 Selcan Hatun went to the wedding, but ... 

481
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,580
 He did not give the literary girl. 

482
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,620
 Osman who wants ... 

483
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
 Literary who does not. 

484
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
 What about you kid? 

485
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
 Why do you say Hamsi Bey? 

486
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,600
 Osman is ultimately his uncle's son. 

487
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,060
 We carry the same blood. 

488
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,560
 Whereas he had followed him so much. 

489
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,020
 Sir, are you better? 

490
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,240
 I'll be better with what I hear from you, my beautiful Sophia. 

491
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,540
 So rest assured ... 

492
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,160
 Alishar Bey's weaknesses are enough to turn him into a puppet. 

493
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,060
 Did you get the news of caravan? 

494
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,760
 Yeah 

495
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,720
 The apricot doesn't stop. 

496
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,640
 Stop them! 

497
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
 This will benefit us. 

498
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,440
 How ? 

499
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,040
 Our dear ally ... 

500
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,140
 Mr. Alişar ... 

501
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,520
 It will do what it takes. 

502
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,740
 Then he will come here ... 

503
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
 I have a promise to him for dinner. 

504
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,680
 But Kalanoz will not like it. 

505
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 Kalanoz is foolish. 

506
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,460
 So I give the biggest task to Kalanoz. 

507
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,660
 He will take the life of Edebalı. 

508
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
 Give this good news, Sophia. 

509
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,800
 Yes, sir. 

510
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,280
 Salvador. 

511
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,160
 He gives the punishment of Batur, who dares to print our caravan ... 

512
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,560
 Your mission. 

513
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,960
 Like a shadow, I will go after that shore bandit. 

514
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,040
 When I hug your throat, what did it mean to have a caravan to understand? 

515
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,140
 Our issue is not Osman who suffers from love. 

516
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,520
 The eyes of the apricot are not so hot ... 

517
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,740
 My lion son is Baturalp. 

518
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,620
 The caravan is thrown like a hawk ... 

519
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,240
 These booties you see lay on our feet ... 

520
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
 So many booty in the middle ... 

521
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,720
 When I had such a lion with me ... 

522
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,540
 No one can spoil my enjoyment. 

523
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,100
 I will break it, Dundar Bey. 

524
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,180
 Alişar Bey. 

525
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,980
 Alişar. 

526
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,960
 Collect them. 

527
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,040
 May you lie down on you ... 

528
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,640
 So that you can enter the order. 

529
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,000
 We gave dormitory. 

530
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,500
 Not just to be a bandit. 

531
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,120
 How long have you been on the hoe and hit the caravan? 

532
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,620
 These are not stupid ... 

533
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,200
 Booty is. They are the goods of Kulucahisar kefer. 

534
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,820
 The testament we sealed together ... 

535
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,680
 When did you forget Dundar Bey? 

536
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,320
 Behold, friendship? 

537
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,400
 What do I say Sophia and Kalanoza now? 

538
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
 There is no friendship, Alişar Bey. 

539
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,260
 When you were away, they raided our alps and killed them. 

540
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,940
 Banane from the lives of your three or five alps? 

541
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,900
 I look at the benefit of Ali Selçuk. 

542
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,820
 When did you get permission from this raid, did Dundar Bey? 

543
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,600
 Are we going to let us know when we shake pusat to the shroud, Alişar? 

544
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,980
 This oba, where you convict the people, 

545
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,420
 This quota you have been holding ... 

546
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
 Playing with your money ... 

547
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,900
 Çala is in this tent where you make children ... 

548
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,320
 Mine. 

549
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,100
 Just me 

550
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,720
 As you asked everything ... 

551
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,180
 You will ask this too! 

552
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,700
 The room of Süleyman Şah ... 

553
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,940
 Oba beeches ... 

554
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
 Honor is Turks Alişar Bey. 

555
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,740
 Go preach to your equine, Batur! 

556
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,300
 Get off me! 

557
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,340
 Now Kulucahisara ... 

558
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,260
 When I take this trophy ... 

559
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,940
 If I see a single needle is missing ... 

560
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,400
 The return of this to you would be a spear. 

561
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,180
 You ordered me, princess Sophia? 

562
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,180
 I have a gift for you. 

563
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,460
 Your presence is the greatest gift for me. 

564
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,540
 So give me a gift. 

565
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,380
 Whatever you want. 

566
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,100
 Take this. 

567
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,000
 This sword for your heroism ... 

568
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,020
 To accompany. 

569
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,500
 When the time comes ... 

570
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,280
 This unique hero ... 

571
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,060
 I will be his wife. 

572
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,240
 These beautiful words are like a song. 

573
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,960
 But whose life do you want from me? 

574
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,580
 The big task has been given to you, darling. 

575
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,760
 This sword is in your hands. 

576
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,840
 You will pierce the heart of Edebalı. 

577
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,460
 Our master is the hardest job .... 

578
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,380
 He gave it to his most reliable soldier. 

579
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,900
 If I had it, I would have done the same. 

580
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,600
 I buy this sword from you as a wedding gift. 

581
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,300
 I will bring you the heart of Edebalı. 

582
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,560
 In that case... 

583
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,220
 It is necessary to make a good plan. 

584
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,260
 No one can stop. 

585
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,080
 A solid plan. 

586
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,140
 God give me strength. 

587
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:37,040
 Let us see the days when we cut off the slapping hand of this Alişar dog. 

588
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,920
 One more breath. 

589
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
 I am not willing to settle. 

590
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,380
 Şükür Osman was not a toy, either. 

591
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,740
 Şükür Osman was not a toy either. 

592
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,660
 We kept ourselves hard ... 

593
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,020
 How were we going to stop him? 

594
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,040
 Now it is up to you to stand behind Dündar Bey. 

595
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,520
 He knows what to do. 

596
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,340
 Then of course you give the right to the pusta. 

597
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,060
 Don't stay like that, chick! 

598
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,000
 This does not stay like this. 

599
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,780
 Incoming ... 

600
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,600
 We slap Alişara in such a way .. 

601
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,680
 What is it to sell in Oba? 

602
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,340
 Then he sees. 

603
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,040
 He sees. 

604
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,680
 Boraalp comes, sir. 

605
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,660
 No, Bora? 

606
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,900
 You're right, sir. 

607
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,440
 Sophia went to her mansion to see Alişar Bey. 

608
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,680
 Where is it now? 

609
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,120
 Mr. Alişar went to the school. 

610
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,560
 Toyu stepped. 

611
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,660
 What do you say, Bora? 

612
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,540
 My son scolded Dündar Bey for printing his caravan. 

613
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,000
 Why would Alişar Bey get involved? 

614
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,080
 What did my em say? 

615
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,980
 What will he say, sir ... 

616
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,820
 Alişar Bey slapped Batur and is in front of everyone. 

617
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,380
 He didn't even get out. 

618
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,680
 Mr. Alişar ... 

619
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,660
 Obviously the castle prepares ... 

620
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,520
 They want to release Alişar Bey to us. 

621
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,720
 Batur will shoot this job. 

622
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:25,840
 Where is Batur 

623
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,740
 After the incident, sir. 

624
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,440
 Both the Alps went behind him. 

625
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,940
 I know where you're going. 

626
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,340
 I'm afraid it will be insane. 

627
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,640
 Where are my Alps? 

628
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,440
 I noticed, sir, they are coming here. 

629
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,960
 If you come to his falcon. 

630
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,920
 Thank you sir. 

631
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,720
 Mr. Dundar! 

632
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,560
 Is it true what I hear? 

633
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,020
 Alişar Bey came and pulled you all in line. 

634
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,120
 Slapped my Batur ... 

635
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,580
 You didn't sound too. 

636
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,820
 With your female mind ... 

637
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,560
 Don't mess with the job, chick. 

638
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,240
 I slapped it with my counsel ... 

639
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,520
 I would not accept this disgrace. 

640
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,480
 To the stout of beech ... 

641
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,820
 What does it mean to slap in the middle of the toy? 

642
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
 How do I accept this? 

643
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,400
 There's a huge starboard gentleman in front of us, chick. 

644
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,820
 Give starboard lord, what do we do if they say your tents? 

645
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,380
 Is there a way we can return to the lands we have migrated to? 

646
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
 Beyond Byzantine. 

647
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,960
 Beyond Mongolian. 

648
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,300
 We try to establish a dorm where we stay here, can you see? 

649
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,220
 Both ... 

650
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,900
 All in all... 

651
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,400
 Alişar Bey is both the magic of Batur ... 

652
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,740
 Also, her brother-in-law is counted. 

653
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,980
 He will not be proud. 

654
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,020
 Yes to shoot! 

655
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,720
 It will attract you! 

656
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,180
 Now it must be like this. 

657
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,820
 If the balance changes tomorrow ... 

658
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:39,580
 Sure that slap ... 

659
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,620
 It does not register. 

660
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,200
 But now it must be like this. 

661
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
 Mother of my sky-eyed Batur ... 

662
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,660
 What is this? 

663
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,280
 Salma is herself. 

664
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,680
 What is Alişar Bey doing, Selcan Hatun? 

665
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,800
 I Batumi ... 

666
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,780
 God knows where? 

667
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,240
 What is it like? 

668
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,300
 Alişar Bey threw that slap into Batur in the apparently. 

669
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,480
 He does not know the abdomen. 

670
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:05,340
 Kaya Obasi does not put that slap with Alişar Bey. 

671
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,540
 But my mind is now in Batur Zöhre. 

672
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,120
 You know him best. 

673
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,920
 Your temper, your water, your heart. 

674
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,760
 Well now he's crazy! 

675
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,640
 When Erlik is said, one is from the other ... 

676
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,400
 Another Elcan Hatun? 

677
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,960
 May Allah give him nothing. 

678
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,900
 To burn my heart worse. 

679
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,440
 Come on, get yourself together. 

680
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,900
 We will stand firm. 

681
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,980
 You will stand firm. 

682
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,940
 You will stand firm to take shelter in prayer. 

683
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,480
 My God brings you to your child at times. 

684
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,660
 Amine. 

685
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,200
 At the time of thesis, your heart will be waived. 

686
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,420
 I hope the unity of our Obama will not be broken. 

687
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,600
 Gentlemen ... 

688
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,920
 Alişar Bey. 

689
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,600
 Big Seljuk's ... 

690
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,640
 Don't you have any respect for Sancak Bey? 

691
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,360
 Also on my land in my market. 

692
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,040
 What is this? 

693
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,220
 You're Alituar Bey. 

694
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,400
 Behlüldale one day in Baghdad's cemetery ... 

695
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,900
 He dug himself and fell asleep inside ... 

696
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,740
 Sultan Resit issued an edict and ... 

697
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,220
 He wanted it to be urgent ... 

698
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,800
 The soldiers started to call Behlül immediately. 

699
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,040
 They finally found it. 

700
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,060
 With the spears in their hands ... 

701
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,360
 They made him wake up by screaming. 

702
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:20,940
 Behlül will this stop? 

703
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,720
 She opened her mouth, closed her eyes ... 

704
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,900
 Why did you wake me? 

705
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,460
 Of course, the soldiers did not listen. 

706
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,620
 They embraced and put them in a breath. 

707
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,660
 Sultan asked mixed with smile ... 

708
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,660
 Are you in the army? 

709
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,400
 Why would you wake me. 

710
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,280
 What is the reason ? 

711
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,620
 Behlül started telling with the same anger. 

712
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,640
 I said ... 

713
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,700
 I became a sultan in my dream ... 

714
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,680
 My soldiers ... 

715
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,000
 Palace ... 

716
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,860
 My maid ... 

717
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,960
 My glory had power ... 

718
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,840
 When they woke up, everything was awful. 

719
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840
 Sultan Reşit started laughing. 

720
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,540
 He said the Jew ... 

721
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,960
 The reign that no man dreams of ... 

722
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,300
 Does it reputation? 

723
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,340
 Behlül looked at a sultan ... 

724
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,620
 And to the soldiers ... 

725
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,020
 Then he said to the sultan ... 

726
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,600
 With my reign in my dream ... 

727
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,360
 What is the difference between your reign? 

728
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,580
 Mine ended when I woke up ... 

729
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
 Yours... 

730
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,920
 It will end when you die. 

731
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,340
 Said 

732
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,220
 Then... 

733
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,940
 Let's look at us, Alişar Bey ... 

734
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,720
 Certainly on the seal of the sultan ... 

735
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,860
 Trusting the soldier behind him ... 

736
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,320
 You try to interrogate greetings. 

737
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,920
 Is it worth for a reign that will eventually end when you die? 

738
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,880
 If you want a thought ... 

739
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,300
 Come unsatisfied and ... 

740
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,600
 Are you without waiting for my passion? 

741
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,600
 Or 

742
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,800
 Is it us who do not respect the arrival of a mortal? 

743
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,260
 My main purpose ... 

744
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:08,200
 Just because you settled in my market without me ... 

745
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,040
 It was to ask you for an account. 

746
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,020
 But I saw that ... 

747
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,380
 There is honor in your existence. 

748
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,820
 Excuse me, my Sheikh. 

749
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,160
 Mr. Alişar ... 

750
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,740
 You know, too ... 

751
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,280
 In the raid made ... 

752
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,820
 Many of my friends were martyred ... 

753
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,720
 This place was irrigated with ahi blood ... 

754
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,120
 It is our land. 

755
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,580
 We know both the Ahi order and the Ahi ceremony. 

756
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,200
 Your presence gives us strength ... 

757
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,780
 Your dignity will add strength to our market. 

758
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,760
 Time to account! 

759
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,660
 Albet will come, Alişar! 

760
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,080
 You disgraced me in front of my gentlemen. 

761
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,060
 Onuralp, Senceralp don't come, leave me alone! 

762
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:15,060
 You mean? 

763
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,860
 I won't leave you alone when I find you. 

764
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,480
 Let's finish our unfinished business. 

765
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,780
 Attack! 

766
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,740
 Come on kill them now. 

767
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,880
 Incompetent guys. 

768
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,080
 Good to come, Osman. 

769
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,120
 Ruhan's blood will not stay on the ground. 

770
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,920
 Let me leave, brother. 

771
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,040
 Not just Ruhan ... 

772
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,380
 We've gotten all your dog. 

773
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,300
 Now it's your turn. 

774
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,080
 Die! 

775
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,360
 Mr. Batur, are you okay? 

776
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,040
 I'm fine Apturrahman Gazi. 

777
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,320
 Then it is up to us to watch the theme. 

778
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,780
 Good bite for us. 

779
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,600
 It is only for us to strip the iron. 

780
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,920
 Are you okay, brother? 

781
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,560
 I'm fine bro 

782
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,280
 I'm alive thanks to you. 

783
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,920
 You are my brother. 

784
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,180
 Let me burn the whole tip into a drop of blood. 

785
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,880
 Thank you bro. 

786
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,860
 With Boğaç and Ertuk ... 

787
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:39,760
 You'll take Batur to the oba. 

788
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,640
 Notify Mamsı Bey, too. 

789
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,200
 We have Aybars' murderer. 

790
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,860
 Thank you sir. 

791
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
 What will we do with this pus, Osman Bey? 

792
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,160
 We will take him to the cave. 

793
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,720
 He will tell those who keep his collar. 

794
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,760
 Guys I ... 

795
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,400
 My mind didn't get my secret ... 

796
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,640
 We entered with a feeling of getting cooled in. 

797
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,460
 Where did I come from, Nizamettin? 

798
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,800
 Beyim from Konya. 

799
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,680
 At least you know that. 

800
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
 Let me tell you that you don't know. 

801
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,720
 Ahval is not good in Konya. 

802
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,380
 We navigate here as the shadow of the sultan. 

803
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,040
 But I arrived in Konya, I saw that ... 

804
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,460
 There is no sultan to be shadowed. 

805
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:08,640
 Nizam is both Mongolian and custom. 

806
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,440
 So what should we do, Nizamettin? 

807
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,040
 You know the truth, sir. 

808
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,800
 To become a Sultan and to obtain shadows. 

809
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,760
 The way to become a sultan is from the money ... 

810
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:31,360
 Akçe's way goes through the tradesman who knows his job well. 

811
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,060
 Now to me. 

812
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,240
 In this land and in the sentence of anatolia ... 

813
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,780
 Is there a better craftsman than the Ahis? 

814
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,980
 No, sir. 

815
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,860
 Then the path of mind is one. 

816
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,220
 Will produce and sell literary and ahis ... 

817
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,520
 Alişar Bey will add wealth to his wealth. 

818
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,260
 You like your hearts. 

819
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,400
 Who is this fresh, Nizamettin? 

820
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,080
 Bala Hatun, the daughter of Edebalı. 

821
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,220
 Bala 

822
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,640
 It will not leave without singing. 

823
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,080
 No easy death for you! 

824
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,460
 Is this the head of those who murdered my son? 

825
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,080
 Osman? 

826
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,260
 This is Hamsı Bey. 

827
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,500
 I Usman. 

828
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
 You say ... 

829
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,600
 You say to me, to the shroud ... 

830
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,920
 Did you give my Aybars death order in this language? 

831
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,580
 Say it to you! 

832
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,960
 You enemies ... 

833
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,180
 Do you hear this with your ear? 

834
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:11,920
 Do you see with this eye? 

835
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,260
 Did you chop it with your hand to my ironbender? 

836
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,200
 Speak, speak! 

837
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:31,140
 Heart as much as hand ... 

838
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,620
 How does it remove so much coffiness? 

839
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,720
 Osman, are you done with this? 

840
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
 When it's done, it's yours, Hamsi. 

841
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:59,700
 When it is over, I am Osman. 

842
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:34,760
 Edebalı's livestock will bring abundance and blessings to the market. 

843
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:38,060
 What did you think well, mind you, sir. 

844
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,960
 Not just the market ... 

845
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:48,220
 Of Edebalı who will reach my bed ... 

846
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,300
 Abundance and abundance. 

847
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,860
 What goes on in mind, sir? 

848
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,060
 No, of course. 

849
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,020
 I liked the bala chick very much. 

850
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:08,740
 What goodness does Allah create ... 

851
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,080
 I witnessed one more time. 

852
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,900
 Such a gazelle eyed ... 

853
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,980
 Coming to a hunter like me ... 

854
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,900
 A separate wisdom. 

855
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,940
 But your marriage is close with my son Aygül Hatun. 

856
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:28,060
 I think you give up. 

857
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,320
 Why should I give up? 

858
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,020
 I am Alişar Bey. 

859
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,320
 My mansion is wide in my heart. 

860
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,560
 Mr. girl in a room ... 

861
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,120
 Another is the sheikh girl. 

862
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,120
 Isn't it better? 

863
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,260
 You are like a lion, sir. 

864
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,260
 But what Dundar Bey ... 

865
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,620
 What if Edebalı accepts this, ask me. 

866
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,120
 Let it not exist. 

867
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,160
 Dundar Bey's daughter is not important. 

868
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,800
 To my mansion ... 

869
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,540
 Beautiful like Bala Hatun ... 

870
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
 He is skilful and befitting. 

871
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,280
 Stop, let's see. 

872
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,960
 Everything has a time. 

873
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,680
 My death won't work for you ... 

874
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,840
 I know a lot I will talk. 

875
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,180
 If you forgive me, I will help you save Edebalı. 

876
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:27,920
 Well! 

877
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,300
 Where will it survive? 

878
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,860
 I'll tell you if you let me live. 

879
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,720
 I will let you live. 

880
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,000
 Said. 

881
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,520
 Tell me! 

882
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,360
 This night... 

883
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,480
 The Edebali ... 

884
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,720
 What will happen to Edebalı tonight? 

885
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,460
 With the men of the calonous ... 

886
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:02,940
 Tonight will kill Edebalı. 

887
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,360
 If you play this time ... 

888
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,520
 Not to live ... 

889
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:15,620
 You beg to die. 

890
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,200
 You're gonna let me live, right? 

891
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,900
 I'll let it. 

892
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:26,320
 But... 

893
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,520
 I don't know what Bamsı Bey says. 

894
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,360
 Don't leave me in her hands. 

895
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,700
 I beg you, Osman Bey. 

896
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,660
 Don't leave it to him! 

897
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,600
 If it is true what this shroud says ... 

898
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,540
 This time we grow strong. 

899
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,520
 Outside, dark horses are tired ... 

900
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,080
 It would be difficult to catch up, Osman Bey. 

901
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,400
 May our companions Khidr. 

902
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,080
 Amine 

903
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:53,920
 Let's go. 

904
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,800
 Princess was the perfect table. 

905
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,700
 The guest will be very satisfied. 

906
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:36,100
 Everything in this castle and its surroundings ... 

907
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,140
 Helen to please us. 

908
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,700
 Come here. 

909
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,600
 Come on, Sancak Bey Alişar ... 

910
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,180
 Tell me what you will do for us. 

911
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,920
 Princess Sophia is waiting for you, Alişar Bey. 

912
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:10,360
 Get well, commander. 

913
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,740
 Thank you Alişar Bey. 

914
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,480
 In the past, we would have been wounded on the battlefield ... 

915
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
 Now while protecting our caravan. 

916
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,820
 Welcome, Mr. Alişar. 

917
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,340
 Goodbye princess. 

918
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,580
 I brought Dundar Bey and Batur in line. 

919
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,520
 In front of all his losses. 

920
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:55,260
 Your confiscated properties were also brought to the castle completely. 

921
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,600
 In order not to have anything like this from now on ... 

922
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,560
 I took all precautions. 

923
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,820
 Get comfortable. 

924
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,900
 That you will do whatever ... 

925
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,680
 I did not have the slightest doubt, Alişar Bey. 

926
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,660
 This... 

927
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,980
 I always brought the fragrances to you, princess. 

928
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,920
 You are very kind. 

929
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,640
 Although it stays unlit beside your beauty ... 

930
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,420
 If you wear this necklace as a symbol of our friendship ... 

931
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,800
 You make me very happy. 

932
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,760
 A very accurate choice. 

933
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,740
 Like all your choices. 

934
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,640
 I prepared basil syrup for you. 

935
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,660
 I hope you will like it. 

936
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:38,260
 Your table also reflects you, princess. 

937
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,540
 Perfect. 

938
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,680
 I'm embarrassed for what happened. 

939
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:55,980
 To compensate for our loss ... 

940
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,620
 You did your best, Alişar Bey. 

941
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,320
 You don't have to be ashamed. 

942
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,580
 After this... 

943
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,520
 Join our forces and ... 

944
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,160
 Besides the profit we will provide ... 

945
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,800
 What does a simple caravan matter? 

946
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:42,280
 Finally the expected day has come. 

947
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,420
 Where are the guards? 

948
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,880
 I called here they will come soon. 

949
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,940
 Finish their job. 

950
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,040
 What about Edebalı's house? 

951
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,780
 Stone house on the back street. 

952
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,560
 When the guards are done, the market remains unprotected. 

953
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,180
 Literary easy. 

954
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,480
 Daughter Bala and Gonca are at home. 

955
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,560
 Two dervishes. 

956
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,580
 Someone who introduced himself in the castle called Pastor Markus. 

957
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,200
 This work will be over tonight. 

958
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:12,820
 Don't be a mistake. 

959
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,680
 Otherwise I will make you pay. 

960
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,280
 No Commander Calosnose. 

961
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,660
 You won't be sure. 

962
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,560
 They will take ablution first. 

963
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:30,240
 They read the Quran without going to bed. 

964
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:07,060
 Osman 

965
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:20,060
 Did you mean we would come? 

966
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,420
 Salvador whispered. 

967
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:27,400
 Now he negotiates with Bamsı for his head. 

968
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:30,120
 The wounds you open in my heart ... 

969
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,960
 It hits the heat on my face ... 

970
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:33,960
 Let me see more. 

971
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,480
 You will be roasted in the wounds you open. 

972
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
 I told you you'll be scorched in your wounds ... 

973
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,520
 For this ironbender ... 

974
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,800
 This is for Kantura. 

975
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:27,660
 Just started ... 

976
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,960
 I've no hurry. 

977
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,280
 Sophia's ... 

978
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,400
 Push the account will be his father ... 

979
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:38,780
 I will see in the wood. 

980
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,600
 Your power is not enough for us Osman. 

981
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,780
 You are nothing for us. 

982
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,420
 Before I got on the horse of Ecelin and destroyed Kulucahisar ... 

983
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:06,200
 Without pouring Sophia's poison from her teeth ... 

984
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:11,020
 Before Yannis was inside the monastery where he came from ... 

985
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,700
 Forbidden death to me! 

986
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:09,060
 I aybars ... 

987
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:12,680
 He did not like pusat before. 

988
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:16,580
 He told me when he was younger ... 

989
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:20,360
 Let Pusat be your father, my pen. 

990
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,480
 I was a horse head back then. 

991
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,720
 Like a buffalo bed, it is sunday ... 

992
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
 I have a chest like a stallion. 

993
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,380
 Powerful. 

994
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:46,900
 Not that... 

995
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:50,740
 My Aybars would still stick, so I wouldn't want pusat. 

996
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,500
 They said then ... 

997
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,820
 Dormitory is conquered with the pusat you call ... 

998
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:03,440
 Just to keep it with a pen. 

999
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,760
 I said OK... 

1000
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,540
 Pusat me too ... 

1001
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,640
 I said, son, keep the pen. 

1002
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:21,660
 But do you ever allow shrouds like you? 

1003
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:27,560
 As a child, they started dealing with my Aybars. 

1004
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:31,420
 They did not allow him to collect knowledge. 

1005
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:34,340
 What do you do, boy? 

1006
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:36,820
 There is no going to be looked ... 

1007
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,960
 Ride on your horse ... 

1008
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,800
 Pusat obliterated his sword. 

1009
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,400
 It has been a fat spring, my son. 

1010
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:53,800
 It rested on the slope of my Osman ... 

1011
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,580
 The two became mountain ranges. 

1012
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,240
 Once upon a time... 

1013
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,540
 My Aybars stood before me ... 

1014
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:10,540
 I said, "I'm a lion boy." 

1015
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,500
 Dad said ... 

1016
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,800
 I have a wish ... 

1017
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,960
 I said you are my son. 

1018
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,800
 You speak from your father ... 

1019
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:28,440
 Your father draws the distant. 

1020
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,960
 I said it would happen. 

1021
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,700
 You wish ... 

1022
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,620
 Your father Bamsı Bey ... 

1023
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,700
 It spreads fire from its mouth ... 

1024
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,800
 I said melt the mountains of iron. 

1025
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,520
 I am in love. 

1026
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:48,840
 Said... 

1027
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,360
 Sevdalandım. 

1028
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,840
 Then... 

1029
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,080
 My heart frothed like the top of the Ak stream. 

1030
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:04,080
 I said okay okay is the steppe ceremony ... 

1031
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,520
 Seven gets his love. 

1032
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,440
 What do you think you're doing Osman Bey? 

1033
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,600
 Do you want to have your Murad like this? 

1034
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,460
 It's not me. 

1035
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,000
 All of you are in danger. 

1036
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:28,380
 My Sheikh. 

1037
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:56,860
 First, we arrive at our shop ... 

1038
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,700
 You took Sunday. 

1039
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:03,240
 Then you became armor to our death. 

1040
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,560
 Now I will ask again, Osman Bey ... 

1041
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:11,700
 Did you? 

1042
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:14,660
 Or a breath? 

1043
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:19,640
 I poured bloody age from my eyes ... 

1044
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,620
 If I ask my shout ... 

1045
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:26,860
 Sheikh Edebalı ... 

1046
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,900
 I said, do you agree to your presence? 

1047
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:34,200
 Have we accepted? 

1048
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,620
 You did not bristle. 

1049
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,880
 Like Eyüp ... 

1050
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:44,360
 If I could be patient with the wolf torment ... 

1051
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:46,380
 Like Yahya ... 

1052
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:49,700
 If I shed bloody tears from my eyes ... 

1053
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,560
 Like Moses ... 

1054
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,800
 If I make tahat on the tour mountain ... 

1055
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:59,400
 Dergah ... 

1056
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,360
 I said, does Sheikh accept the Literary? 

1057
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:05,540
 Have we done it? 

1058
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:06,700
 You did not bristle. 

1059
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,400
 Like a dolphin ... 

1060
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,240
 If I were fish in Derya ... 

1061
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:16,660
 Like Yusuf ... 

1062
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:19,800
 If I stay day and night in the well ... 

1063
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,200
 Like Jacob ... 

1064
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:26,360
 If I cry blood for Yusuf ... 

1065
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:30,800
 Şeyh Edebalı on the River ... 

1066
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,300
 I said, would he accept it? 

1067
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,900
 Have we done it? 

1068
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:36,880
 You did not bristle. 

1069
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,660
 Ezel day ... 

1070
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:44,080
 I am embarrassed and ashamed of you, Sheikh Edebalı. 

1071
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:48,640
 Finally I say ... 

1072
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:51,840
 I am informal ... 

1073
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,460
 A happy breath ... 

1074
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,160
 It is a prayer. 

1075
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,360
 There are abdalan ... 

1076
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,900
 Swept by love and came to our threshold ... 

1077
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:13,120
 There are Bacıyan ... 

1078
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:16,700
 Our task on our way ... 

1079
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,640
 But... 

1080
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,720
 Your only aim ... 

1081
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,940
 Your only wish ... 

1082
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,740
 On the right way ... 

1083
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:28,600
 The gas must be son. 

1084
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:32,400
 Our breath ... 

1085
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:35,140
 As we fight for the sake of gas ... 

1086
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,400
 I will be with you, son. 

1087
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,160
 Thank you Sheikh Edebalı. 

1088
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:46,780
 In the way of Allah .... 

1089
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,480
 The persecution of Oghuz tribes ... 

1090
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:52,200
 It is to be mania. 

1091
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:54,720
 With this aim ... 

1092
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,040
 Let those who don't. 

1093
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,520
 For the right for love ... 

1094
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,200
 Putting the world business behind you is not worth it. 

1095
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,600
 Being in the head of those who are not, it is good for you. 

1096
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:14,040
 My dad told you ... 

1097
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:16,260
 He called it the light of Oghuz. 

1098
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:21,360
 Even if it is at the expense of our dear ... 

1099
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:25,380
 We don't let this light go out. 

1100
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,860
 Allah Almighty 

1101
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:35,140
 Hz. As he examined Adam by not approaching the tree ... 

1102
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,880
 Adem's sons ... 

1103
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:40,440
 In any case and situation ... 

1104
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:44,920
 Osman Bey quizzes with patience and thanks. 

1105
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:51,520
 Because everything that happens to a person in the world of wisdom ... 

1106
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,760
 A hidden reason ... 

1107
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,600
 And it is by wisdom. 

1108
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:59,460
 With patience and thanks. 

1109
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:03,140
 In the shadows. 

1110
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,880
 It was good for us to cook. 

1111
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:11,840
 Thank you for that too. 

1112
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:05,060
 At your door ... 

1113
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:06,780
 My Sheikh started cooking. 

1114
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:32,820
 Mr. Osman 

1115
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:36,040
 Bala Hatun ... 

1116
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:39,120
 Sheikh literary 

1117
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:42,240
 Thank God its breath and prayer are with us. 

1118
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,280
 Thank god. 

1119
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,300
 Beyond that is patience. 

1120
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:51,060
 Waiting patiently for your father to call us falls. 

1121
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:54,080
 evelallah 

1122
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,480
 We also have a heart to wait. 

1123
02:04:58,460 --> 02:04:59,920
 Our passion. 

1124
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:05,020
 Now with your leave. 

1125
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,560
 Osman Bey is yours. 

1126
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,440
 God let him open the way. 

1127
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,060
 All of us are fire. 

1128
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,540
 All of us ... 

1129
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:55,660
 Copperhead. 

1130
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,960
 Where does it suddenly go? 

1131
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,660
 Why does this Batur not know? 

1132
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:05,120
 Pride was hurt in all of my brains, my son. 

1133
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:08,020
 Did you leave the face to the Oba? 

1134
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:12,840
 If he struck, he shot the man who would be his brother-in-law. 

1135
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,600
 He didn't shoot. 

1136
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
 If you don't sound, it hits again. 

1137
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:21,940
 What is wrong with what my Batur said is that he raised his hand? 

1138
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:23,720
 Hey, hey. 

1139
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,440
 What days are we up to? 

1140
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,420
 Son of loss ... 

1141
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:31,220
 He slaps a starboard brain with cinnamon on his beard. 

1142
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,980
 God, make our end no. 

1143
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:48,920
 I Baturina. 

1144
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:52,180
 What happened to you? 

1145
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:57,300
 Son... 

1146
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,120
 I ambushed in the forest. 

1147
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:05,880
 Osman saved my life. 

1148
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:36,740
 Master Yannis. 

1149
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,300
 Kalonoz. 

1150
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:41,760
 What happened? 

1151
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,240
 We found his body in front of the castle, sir. 

1152
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,520
 Stupid fool. 

1153
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,460
 How is it? 

1154
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,480
 I don't know, sir. 

1155
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:01,820
 Muslim hair in Uzbekistan. 

1156
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:03,800
 There are many sores on his body. 

1157
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,380
 Sophie ... 

1158
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:09,880
 Does Sophia know about this? 

1159
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,220
 Sir is having dinner with princess Sophia Alişar Bey. 

1160
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:14,940
 He is not aware of the situation yet. 

1161
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:15,940
 Beautiful. 

1162
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:18,620
 What is your order? 

1163
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:21,040
 Kalonoza dress your own clothes ... 

1164
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:25,840
 Then, you will encounter Sophia and Alişar Bey. 

1165
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:30,660
 Alişar Bey persecuted by the Turks ... 

1166
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:34,920
 And let's see how aggressive they don't know the rule. 

1167
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:47,800
 I promise you for your safety from today 

1168
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:52,860
 Moreover, I made another caravan for you. 

1169
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,360
 He'll be here soon. 

1170
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:59,140
 Your stalls in the market in caravans ... 

1171
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:01,960
 Under my protection. 

1172
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:05,360
 Just like you... 

1173
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,540
 A strong starboard brain support always empowers us. 

1174
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,620
 But... 

1175
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,620
 The Edebali ... 

1176
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:19,100
 If the market dominates this ... 

1177
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,820
 We all get harmful. 

1178
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:26,160
 Literary and dominate the market ... 

1179
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:32,360
 It's not possible when I'm there, princess. 

1180
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:38,120
 Literary and hereafter will stimulate the market. 

1181
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:42,460
 But under my shadow. 

1182
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:48,160
 And as long as they bring us. 

1183
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:57,920
 How will you prevent them? 

1184
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,780
 How? 

1185
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,800
 Ambushed on the way back to the castle, sir. 

1186
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:48,200
 Who does this? 

1187
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:50,620
 The Turks. 

1188
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:57,940
 Osman 

1189
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:00,740
 Osman did it, I know that. 

1190
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:05,320
 This is not just an attack on us ... 

1191
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:10,840
 Alişar Bey is an upset that ignores you. 

1192
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:19,680
 I want Osman's life. 

1193
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:40,160
 I said son, bravery, no shield. 

1194
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:44,940
 He turned and looked ... 

1195
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:50,120
 He smiled so much that ... 

1196
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:55,360
 Coming from the steppes with nine fringed bricks ... 

1197
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:57,460
 Ancestors passed before my eyes. 

1198
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:02,120
 He looked at that ... 

1199
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,920
 Hz. Hamza's ... 

1200
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,680
 He had a look in his eyes. 

1201
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:11,760
 Why didn't you say stop? 

1202
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:14,820
 Is it called stop to gas? Bre wacky! 

1203
02:13:15,940 --> 02:13:17,100
 Called go! 

1204
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:21,260
 So he's not up to his mind. 

1205
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,340
 It's called Git. 

1206
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:24,900
 It is called Git ... 

1207
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:28,340
 Get out of your nafs. 

1208
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:36,920
 I said don't put my Osman alone ... 

1209
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:45,760
 To be called homeland to the lands where bullies like you traveled ... 

1210
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:50,620
 I said yitesin son. 

1211
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:57,280
 Gone. 

1212
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:07,420
 Gone. 

1213
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:13,960
 It didn't come any more. 

1214
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,800
 His father's ... 

1215
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:26,620
 Martyr's father ... 

1216
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,360
 The lands where the tombstone was planted ... 

1217
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:37,580
 It made us a homeland. 

1218
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:50,020
 You also know that bravery is not armor to rottenness. 

1219
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,320
 It is necessary to be on guard. 

1220
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,460
 It is time. 

1221
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:43,260
 Thank God I am ... 

1222
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:47,600
 My son Aybars' blood will not stay on the ground. 

1223
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,940
 I Bismillahirahmanirah. 

1224
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:55,020
 Mr. Bamsı. 

1225
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:02,500
 I don't want to die without being a Muslim. 

1226
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:32,620
 My darling... 

1227
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,240
 I will take revenge ... 

1228
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:41,360
 I swear, Osman, without paying the price ... 

1229
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:46,060
 I will not leave her collar. 

1230
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:30,420
 When we reach our ambition ... 

1231
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:33,840
 In him, his soul will be in peace, my daughter. 

1232
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:37,260
 My dear daughter Sophia ... 

1233
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:41,700
 To account for the calonosis and other losses ... 

1234
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:43,420
 We will survive. 

1235
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:46,460
 In our lawsuit, it suits us ... 

1236
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:48,780
 Do not shed tears ... 

1237
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:53,140
 It is standing upright in front of those who do this. 

1238
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:14,480
 Your blood won't stay on the floor. 

1239
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:28,420
 Like you like mountains ... 

1240
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:31,200
 I saw it shoulder to shoulder or I was shawl. 

1241
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:34,640
 May Allah bless you. 

1242
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:42,900
 He lurks like a coyote on the voyage. 

1243
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:50,500
 Thank goodness Osman I came out of the trap with my brother's claws. 

1244
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:53,380
 For now we're out, bro. 

1245
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,940
 Let's not stop anymore. 

1246
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:01,420
 The wolves are in wolves ... 

1247
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:03,180
 Push it to it. 

1248
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,240
 Everyone understood the original. 

1249
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:09,380
 In the snakes in Kulucahisar ... 

1250
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:12,440
 The leader of the sanjak in Eskihisar ... 

1251
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:14,920
 It is an enemy to us. 

1252
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:18,440
 What does Alişar Bey have to do with this job, Osman? 

1253
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:22,060
 Yengen tells the truth, my nephew. 

1254
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:26,440
 Do not you know soon the wedding ceremony will be established. 

1255
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:30,220
 Before Alşar stepped on the floor ... 

1256
02:20:31,140 --> 02:20:33,140
 He met Sophia at her mansion. 

1257
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:39,640
 Oba blew the fire ... 

1258
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:41,580
 It is clear that it fills the chest. 

1259
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:51,360
 Osman, how about you bro? 

1260
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:01,480
 Egregious! 

1261
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:02,920
 Kosches are shot. 

1262
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:04,500
 Who is it? 

1263
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:21,440
 Your wrath came, Dundar Bey. 

1264
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,900
 This business has lost its desire. 

1265
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:33,140
 What do you think you are, Alişar Bey? 

1266
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:37,800
 It's not me ... 

1267
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:40,860
 You ask Osman. 

1268
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
 Osman 

1269
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:51,120
 From killing you Kolucahisar commander Calosus ... 

1270
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:52,720
 I'm arresting.

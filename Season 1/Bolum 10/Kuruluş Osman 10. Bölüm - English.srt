1
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,180
 What is Mr. Alişar Bey about? 

2
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,220
 It doesn't bare my Sheikh's soul. 

3
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,540
 If my father contracts, he sends with his abad. 

4
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,800
 Do not worry. 

5
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 Mommy, mother, stop ... 

6
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,980
 Isn't there anyone to help you? 

7
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,140
 But does Alişar Bey suit a gentleman like you? 

8
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,620
 You help the mother to her house. 

9
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,040
 May God bless you like you? 

10
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
 The brain without the peace of the people ... 

11
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,300
 There is no vegan. 

12
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,680
 You don't miss your prayer, Mother. 

13
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,240
 God bless you. 

14
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,820
 Listen to me! 

15
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,140
 After that, lunch will be taken out at noon. 

16
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,380
 It will be distributed to the grudges in the market. 

17
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
 Become a Sunday, Bala Hatun. 

18
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,700
 Thank you Alişar Bey 

19
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,340
 Hullo. 

20
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
 You had a lot of goodies with your hands again. 

21
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,100
 Even a smile ... 

22
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,980
 Bala Hatun is like a boon to me. 

23
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
 I repent. 

24
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,820
 You ignore ... 

25
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,260
 But you understand my feelings. 

26
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,860
 I would like to sultan you to my heart. 

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I was caught in the best of the world. 

28
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
 But from your hands ... 

29
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
 It is nice to be devastated. 

30
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,180
 I want you to know... 

31
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,060
 I opened my heart to your father ... 

32
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,780
 It does not give consent. 

33
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
 But I will wait. 

34
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
 A smile ... 

35
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,860
 A look ... 

36
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,280
 Vuslat will be the seed of hope for my garden. 

37
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
 You can hardly put Alişar Bey. 

38
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,180
 The rose without the consent garden is not said. 

39
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 Wait, Bala Hatun. 

40
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
 While I wait, I repeat ... 

41
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
 O heavenly face ... 

42
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 I'm so busy with you ... 

43
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,000
 I don't even remember myself. 

44
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
 You exceed the border, Alişar Bey. 

45
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,660
 Not worthy! 

46
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,320
 There is nothing beyond what I said I would say. 

47
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,180
 We broke Gündüz's arm and wing over the command ... 

48
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,680
 It has already reached the oba. 

49
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,800
 Let's say get back then. 

50
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
 Let's say that Alişar Bey's evil ... 

51
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
 Have a good memory. 

52
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,480
 Osman. 

53
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,380
 This is an antichrist. 

54
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 He threw me in the hands of Alişar. 

55
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,380
 Alişar Bey will not leave this job behind. 

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,060
 Thanks to Yannis, we infiltrated the mind of Alişar Bey. 

57
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,860
 In all his decision after that ... 

58
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 It will serve us. 

59
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
 Balances are sensitive ... 

60
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 Even the margin is important. 

61
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,520
 Yannis will calculate and inform us ... 

62
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,940
 After this... 

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,800
 For Alişar Bey ... 

64
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,540
 All roads will lead to Apdül. 

65
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,980
 Selamun aleykum. 

66
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
 And hey hello. 

67
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
 You are afraid of Allah. 

68
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,580
 You pierced the mountain. 

69
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460
 Flowing water did not keep algae. 

70
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
 Osman Bey's not to flow ... 

71
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
 Casting, mahal. 

72
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
 We're just getting started, brothers. 

73
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
 God willing... 

74
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,120
 We will demolish all the embankments that we encounter. 

75
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,500
 Are you hungry, my lion? 

76
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
 We... 

77
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,860
 Shoulder to shoulder ... 

78
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,780
 As long as we give back to back ... 

79
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
 Nobody can stand before us. 

80
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
 As for Alişar Bey '... 

81
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,360
 Now it is about to arrive at the oba ... 

82
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
 When you think of it, kayı will increase your reputation. 

83
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,460
 How's the situation, chick? 

84
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,140
 It beats the pulse slowly. 

85
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
 I did not say with Ayşe Hatun, but ... 

86
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
 His condition is bad. 

87
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
 I removed all four arrows, but ... 

88
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,340
 Beyim comes to our room with the soldiers of Alişar Bey. 

89
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
 Alişar Bey is on his mind ... 

90
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
 He will try to give an eye mountain to the apricots. 

91
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,220
 Dündar Bey will foam when he finds out that we have bought the gold. 

92
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,260
 Emmim's loyalty to the apricot is indisputable. 

93
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
 But his clairvoyance is lacking. 

94
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,220
 He cannot see beyond. 

95
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
 He will think that we are forbidden too. 

96
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
 But it is not wrong, sir. 

97
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
 He does not know that the gold came from Mongolian. 

98
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
 But Alişar Bey knows that he is a Mongolian dog. 

99
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
 In order not to shake my order ... 

100
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,320
 Obedience also insists. 

101
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,820
 We... 

102
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
 We will overcome the dirty traps one by one. 

103
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,420
 We will take it from the cruel and give it to the innocent. 

104
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
 Not obedience to luck ... 

105
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
 Defies shields. 

106
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
 I heard what happened to Gündüz. 

107
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,220
 My heart twisted. 

108
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,240
 I have come to the past. 

109
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,580
 Alişar Bey, an ambush was established in Kahpe. 

110
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,500
 How is he? 

111
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,660
 His wound is deep ... 

112
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,780
 Who did it? 

113
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,340
 We are on the trail. 

114
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,340
 Soon his face is revealed. 

115
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
 But whoever did this ... 

116
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,560
 He will pay the price very heavily. 

117
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,240
 Cut the trick, Dundar! 

118
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
 I taught Gündüz! 

119
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,460
 On my land ... 

120
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,000
 In My Caravanserai ... 

121
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
 Did you go to Çapula? 

122
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,860
 We are not shod ... 

123
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
 Thank you, Alişar Bey! 

124
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,800
 Gas! 

125
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
 Raiding and stealing goods ... 

126
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
 To ambush and pillage ... 

127
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
 How long has the accident Dundar! 

128
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,380
 Your betrayal stories are over ... 

129
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,140
 Now to us ... 

130
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,920
 You accuse of stealing? 

131
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
 Stealing the gold of Alişar Bey ... 

132
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
 It's not theft ... 

133
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,180
 What! 

134
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,580
 To someone else's property ... 

135
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,360
 Especially Sancak Bey's ... 

136
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,220
 The brave person who will stare ... 

137
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Kayı cannot wear armor. 

138
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,140
 Alişar Bey. 

139
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 I know all by name. 

140
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 These are the signs of Osman. 

141
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,600
 Osman's works! 

142
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,300
 Let Erkut get to the market. 

143
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
 Alişar is among those next to the dog ... 

144
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,320
 There are those who serve Yannis. 

145
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,940
 Open your eyes and ears ... 

146
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
 You will find out who they are. 

147
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 Yannis' hand is long. 

148
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,180
 We need to be one step ahead of him. 

149
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
 Otherwise, all our efforts go to waste. 

150
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
 Does Beyim have a man in Kervansaray? 

151
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
 There are ... 

152
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
 Alişar knows that we do this job. 

153
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,500
 Yannis and Alişar do business, sir? 

154
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,420
 It's too early to say that. 

155
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,540
 But they found a way and surrounded the alsar. 

156
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
 We will start preparations. 

157
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
 All equipment is here. 

158
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
 You take out malulamats. 

159
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
 If you control the weapons. 

160
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 We will enter the castle. 

161
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,340
 Buying the gold that Alişar wants from there ... 

162
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,000
 We will give it to him. 

163
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,060
 This is the last warning to the apricots. 

164
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,880
 If Osman's gold was stolen ... 

165
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,020
 If he doesn't bring his double until tomorrow ... 

166
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
 All of you end up like the Day! 

167
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,840
 You do not, Alişar Bey! 

168
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680
 We have so much gold ... 

169
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,900
 How do we complete it in such a short time. 

170
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,780
 Touch my pole ... 

171
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,820
 I wash your tent. 

172
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,780
 Break my branch ... 

173
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,560
 I burn your mountain. 

174
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,200
 I am Alişar Bey. 

175
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,620
 Mr. Alişar! 

176
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,840
 Open your ear ... 

177
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,340
 Listen well! 

178
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
 If my gold doesn't come ... 

179
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
 For the sign of worship ... 

180
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,760
 It washes your ... 

181
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
 It breaks your privates ... 

182
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
 I drive your Eurasia. 

183
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,060
 You're even! 

184
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,980
 Look at Onur ... 

185
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
 There is no hole left, like a mole. 

186
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,880
 Osman Bey hadn't let us out there in time ... 

187
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 They were hunting us like partridge. 

188
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
 Sophia is awake. 

189
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,260
 They held everywhere. 

190
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
 Beyim has a hole between the walls ... 

191
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
 We sneak out from there. 

192
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,740
 We leak and leak ... 

193
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
 How do we get in after that? 

194
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
 Let's sneak inside the chests, sir. 

195
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 The enemy will not be stuck in the same place. 

196
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
 I know a secret passage ... 

197
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
 We will have infiltrated without waking anyone. 

198
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 We went back, you came back, you came back. 

199
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 We don't have dungeons, is that secret passage? 

200
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,500
 Sıddık is the word, Osman Bey. 

201
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
 I will bring you gold. 

202
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
 Oh Osman ah! 

203
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
 What did you do to us? 

204
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
 Osman came out because I would follow us. 

205
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,200
 I think he knew that Alişar Bey would come here, he did not want to crush himself. 

206
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,100
 Not one but two ... 

207
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
 Patience has cracked, sir. 

208
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,100
 What about Osman with the bridle? 

209
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
 Or cut the ceremony. 

210
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
 Or all the oba will disappear because of it. 

211
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,620
 You get the speed to go to the zöhre a little slow again! 

212
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 He is in trouble during the daytime. 

213
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
 All the oba is under threat ... 

214
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,840
 You still defend Osman. 

215
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,360
 What did Osman say so far, it turned out blank? 

216
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
 What did he not explain? 

217
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,120
 I ask you now ... 

218
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,840
 Maybe we got hurt ... 

219
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,540
 It will burn even more. 

220
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,460
 However, if Osman did something, he knows it. 

221
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
 No, Selcan Hatun ... 

222
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,820
 It doesn't work like that. 

223
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 Osman pushes the boundaries. 

224
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340
 My nephew is my dear ... 

225
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
 It is my blood, my dear, but is it ... 

226
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,500
 If you say Osman ... 

227
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,620
 I give up Osman. 

228
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,540
 Then he knows himself. 

229
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
 Give your heart relief, father. 

230
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
 Your eyes with a wide range, my father. 

231
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
 Bala is a victim to you. 

232
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,780
 The prophet of mercy fell on my beloved. 

233
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,240
 As I saw his state, 

234
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,580
 Who knows how he is suffering. 

235
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,780
 Who knows his heart ... 

236
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,880
 How hurt he is. 

237
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
 Crusaders, Mongols ... 

238
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,940
 Nice spilled the blood of the muslim ... 

239
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
 He defiled our honor. 

240
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 It hurt our scout. 

241
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,780
 The idea of ​​bondage ... 

242
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
 He became sovereign. 

243
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,580
 Muslims invading their hearts ... 

244
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 Spite, hate ... 

245
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,680
 Treachery... 

246
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,640
 Slander... 

247
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,580
 Lust. 

248
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,700
 This state of his ummah is our master ... 

249
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 How much he grieves. 

250
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,260
 All the ordeal ... 

251
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,500
 All the persecution ... 

252
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,780
 Did he pull for this? 

253
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,480
 Ummah ... 

254
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,220
 So that he can worship his Lord in peace ... 

255
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 Nice trouble ... 

256
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,680
 Did he stand up for this? 

257
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,900
 Nice comrade ... 

258
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,180
 Did he sacrifice for this state? 

259
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
 What about the Muslim? 

260
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
 Because the sects are separate ... 

261
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
 They murder each other. 

262
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,720
 They cannot form an alliance against persecution. 

263
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
 Tomorrow is on the Day of Judgment ... 

264
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,920
 In the face of our master who said "my ummah" ... 

265
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 How are we going to look girl? 

266
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,240
 How? 

267
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 What you said in the caravanserai ... 

268
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,960
 It turned out, Apdül. 

269
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,680
 Say it now. 

270
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,720
 Where did Osman hide my gold? 

271
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,540
 Guys I ... 

272
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,040
 It has a secret ... 

273
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,020
 We can not see .. 

274
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,240
 This information ... 

275
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,180
 It is a mystery. 

276
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 What are you gonna do? 

277
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,520
 Say it directly. 

278
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,220
 Guys I ... 

279
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,820
 In the spirits world ... 

280
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,040
 the Gold ... 

281
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,840
 I see more precious, sir ... 

282
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
 What? Tell me! 

283
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,620
 Osman's reputation ... 

284
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,460
 Oba ... 

285
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
 It was destroyed. 

286
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
 There will be more, sir. 

287
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,620
 Majesty ... 

288
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,120
 Everyone... 

289
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,100
 Scares. 

290
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,980
 Your power digests, sir. 

291
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
 Close ... 

292
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,940
 Waiting for you on your way ... 

293
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,700
 There are great victories. 

294
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,460
 Go on. 

295
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 The fire inside ... 

296
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
 I see the desire, sir. 

297
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,960
 Ruling ... 

298
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
 Big lands ... 

299
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
 You wish to dominate. 

300
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 Sultan ... 

301
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,440
 Not its shadow ... 

302
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,780
 You want to be the sultan himself. 

303
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,180
 I want. 

304
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,740
 Go on! 

305
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
 Infidel wife, sir ... 

306
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
 The enemy appears to you ... 

307
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
 But you will be your best friend. 

308
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
 Muradin passes through him. 

309
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,820
 When you are with her ... 

310
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,540
 It will be strength to you. 

311
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
 Mighty mountains ... 

312
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
 It will cross the realms. 

313
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,780
 Filling our hearts with the spirit of faith ... 

314
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
 With the 99 names of Allah Almighty. 

315
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 Valiant gentlemen of beech ... 

316
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,980
 There is no point in defrauding the word. 

317
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,380
 The threats of Alişar Bey ... 

318
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 You all know. 

319
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,400
 On the way to a state ... 

320
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 Just to take a look ... 

321
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,020
 I wanted to consult you. 

322
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
 Osman Bey bought the gold of Alişar Bey. 

323
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,480
 You brought him as chief assistant. 

324
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 But I see that there is no toy. 

325
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,660
 Why doesn't he come and tell us anything? 

326
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,340
 There is nothing Osman. 

327
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
 These works are the signs of Alişar. 

328
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
 Gold also comes from the mongolian. 

329
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,880
 Demirci Bey comes from the Mongolian ... 

330
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
 Do not get mad at Alişar. 

331
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,140
 But when you come to Osman, you ask for an account? 

332
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
 Now it is not decomposition ... 

333
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 Alliance is time. 

334
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,280
 The amount that Alişar Bey wanted ... 

335
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,300
 We have to take it off. 

336
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 Demirci Bey has spoken Bamsı Bey. 

337
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,480
 Since this is the reason, Osman Bey ... 

338
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,140
 Bring us the gold and get us out of this pit. 

339
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,020
 In my opinion... 

340
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
 My nephew's golds ... 

341
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,740
 Distributed to the Gariban. 

342
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,740
 Since Osman ... 

343
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,120
 I have no hope. 

344
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,140
 Then it is up to us to clean it behind Osman. 

345
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
 It is necessary to be vigilant against Alişar. 

346
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,580
 If you command me, I will go to war with my alps. 

347
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,900
 A possible conflict ... 

348
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,360
 Not only to Alişar but also to his judgment ... 

349
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,520
 It also includes Mongolian, where it is Ram. 

350
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,020
 Now you need ... 

351
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,580
 If we have anything to hit the coin, gold ... 

352
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,020
 It is to take off wool. 

353
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,440
 Everybody keep an arm. 

354
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,380
 The flock here, the goods in the warehouse ... 

355
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
 Weaving in Kilimhane ... 

356
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,020
 I would like to know the amount. 

357
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,320
 We will sell everything if necessary ... 

358
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
 But our obese is tarumar ... 

359
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
 We will not allow. 

360
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
 Where are the horns you say? 

361
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,180
 Show me. 

362
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,580
 Right here. 

363
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
 At the back entrance of the walls protecting the castle. 

364
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,060
 What did you do with your eyebrow? 

365
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,340
 What do you have in mind? 

366
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,260
 Samsa Sergeant ... 

367
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,100
 If he made a secret way out of the fortress, 

368
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
 He also set up a trap for those who would fit. 

369
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
 We are a flock of falcons. 

370
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
 We do not have a prop for owl. 

371
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
 Then it will stop ... 

372
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
 Cenk your appetite is black, Apturrahman Gazi. 

373
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
 Son, we say to this end ... 

374
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,080
 The day we came behind the red brick ... 

375
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,400
 We decided on Kavli. 

376
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,620
 The last sweat in our forehead ... 

377
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
 The last blood in our vein ... 

378
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Until the last arrow on our back ... 

379
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
 Fight for Allah and ... 

380
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,560
 We will be a cruel nightmare. 

381
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,240
 Osman's ... 

382
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,880
 Look what he did to us, Selcan Hatun. 

383
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
 We count the property ... 

384
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,780
 In order to pay the gold of Alişar ... 

385
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
 I say from the beginning ... 

386
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,860
 You will not listen. 

387
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,560
 It is not enough by itself ... 

388
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,500
 It will release the oba into wholesale fires. 

389
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
 Sancak Bey's ... 

390
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,140
 What would you do with haunting your gold, Osman? 

391
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,040
 Emmi ... 

392
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,920
 This homeland ... 

393
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,720
 Feeding is not spoils ... 

394
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,200
 Halal suckled lions will manage. 

395
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
 Those golds are not Alişar's ... 

396
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,280
 It is strange, poor, fukaran. 

397
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,660
 Alişar Bey came to the camp and vomited fire. 

398
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,560
 It would be to Gündüz, which was less. 

399
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
 Don't you ever count them? 

400
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,020
 We were obliged to the threats of Alişar ... 

401
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,620
 Until now, we were still driving goats in Aleppo. 

402
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,780
 If you came early and said this to your toy boys! 

403
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,340
 I speak with my pus, not with words! 

404
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,440
 Expediency is your job is my job! 

405
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,140
 Your only action ... 

406
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,780
 Tare to absorb. 

407
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,040
 I have given my assistant duty ... 

408
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,540
 I get! 

409
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620
 My loyalty to Kayı ... 

410
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,500
 Dundar Bey is not a duty to duty! 

411
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
 How faithful he is ... 

412
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,040
 We will see until tomorrow ... 

413
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,000
 This is the time that Sancak Bey gave. 

414
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
 Don't bother for your post. 

415
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,220
 I will bring the gold of Alişar to you. 

416
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
 Maybe what you say is right ... 

417
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 But this is what ... 

418
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,740
 It is not true. 

419
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
 You keep your heart fresh, aunt. 

420
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,140
 For what you say wrong to me today ... 

421
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
 You will pray to me tomorrow. 

422
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
 I'll see my brother. 

423
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
 How is my brother's status? 

424
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,380
 Osman is bad. 

425
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
 He is not yet. 

426
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,860
 Oh strange Day! 

427
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
 If he knew what his brother ... 

428
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
 What happened is Zöhre! 

429
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
 Mixing medium here. 

430
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
 Is he lying if he knew? 

431
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
 Would a Yiğit fall like an ambush? 

432
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,060
 Day. 

433
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
 Let me be the victim, open your eyes. 

434
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,180
 Brother. 

435
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,360
 Thank god. 

436
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,320
 I Usman. 

437
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
 Alişar Bey 

438
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,080
 Osman 

439
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
 Kayi on 

440
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,200
 How do we get out of all this trouble, princess? 

441
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,480
 The stars are very different from each other, Helen. 

442
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,940
 Just like people. 

443
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,620
 Especially Venus ... 

444
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
 He is immense ... 

445
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 The sky is the most magnificent star. 

446
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
 We will be just like Venus. 

447
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,380
 With all the stars fading in the darkness we fall into ... 

448
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,900
 With the light we get from the sun, we will shine like Venus. 

449
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,220
 Princess Sophia ... 

450
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
 Master Yannis sent news. 

451
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
 Mr. Alişar will be here tonight. 

452
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 It was as you said, princess. 

453
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,040
 He sent the sunlight back to Venus. 

454
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
 Master Yannis did a great job. 

455
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,640
 In that case... 

456
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,720
 Let the preparations begin. 

457
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
 I don't want any missing. 

458
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,560
 It's time to show Alişar Bey the splendor of Venus. 

459
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
 Thank you, princess. 

460
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
 Brother must go out. 

461
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,700
 Osman... 

462
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,960
 Brother... 

463
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,080
 Now this wound does not lift me up ... 

464
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,620
 When I was like this ... 

465
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,740
 If something happens to you ... 

466
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
 Tare you know you know. 

467
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
 Come on, brother. 

468
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,400
 Don't worry. 

469
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,000
 I Uthman ... 

470
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,560
 Even gentlemen have become enemies to you ... 

471
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
 You never worry, Bamsı Bey. 

472
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,720
 It's time to get on top of the enemy. 

473
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
 Cenk is the polish of the valiant. 

474
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,540
 Otherwise, we'll pass. 

475
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,540
 Come on then to the horses. 

476
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,080
 Welcome 

477
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,200
 We're [I'm] glad to be here 

478
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
 We heard about what happened to Gündüz Bey. 

479
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,720
 We said let's get past. 

480
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,700
 Thanks. 

481
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,620
 The arrow missed his heart. 

482
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,080
 To get rid of. 

483
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,400
 The main wound that opens up to that heart ... 

484
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,620
 A wound was opened in my heart ... 

485
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
 Always bleeds ... 

486
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,340
 I wouldn't drive if they gave me the medicine ... 

487
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,680
 Let me bleed. 

488
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,200
 The wound of love is also pleasant. 

489
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,640
 I wait, Osman. 

490
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
 You are my homeland in this world. 

491
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,940
 For every moment you expect ... 

492
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
 I will give you a lifetime of happiness. 

493
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,620
 Be patient. 

494
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,260
 Don't miss your prayer, my rose face. 

495
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,940
 Take care. 

496
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,560
 You too, Osman. 

497
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 God help and help you. 

498
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,460
 Go. 

499
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,940
 Onuralp ... 

500
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,840
 I will forget how long I will ask ... 

501
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,040
 What is the trace in your eye? 

502
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
 It's Mongolian business, Samsa Sergeant. 

503
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
 Mongolian's business. 

504
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
 The wound has passed but ... 

505
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
 Obviously his pain is fresh. 

506
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
 It is not the pain that burns my heart ... 

507
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
 It is brother longing. 

508
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,920
 When Osman Bey saved me from the Mongolian prison market ... 

509
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,520
 I had my brother with me ... 

510
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,220
 We were together ... 

511
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,020
 He remained in their hands. 

512
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,900
 I made one last move to save him ... 

513
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,360
 I stayed with the pusat that I ate in my eyes. 

514
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,320
 I wish I had no eye ... 

515
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,940
 If my brother was with me. 

516
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,480
 My Honor ... 

517
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
 Is there any news of your brother? 

518
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,120
 Have you traced? 

519
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,260
 My brother says I am Boran. 

520
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,540
 I say brother. 

521
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,660
 A person I didn't enter ... 

522
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
 There is no market left. 

523
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
 He looks for his scent ... 

524
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
 I look everywhere. 

525
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,720
 We have smashed the wound to you. 

526
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,740
 I'm sorry. 

527
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,260
 He never held a crust ... 

528
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
 Samsa Sergeant always bleeds. 

529
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,220
 We did not fall from the same father ... 

530
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,340
 We were not born from the same mother, but ... 

531
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,440
 We are road siblings, even if we are not a brother. 

532
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,420
 We are. 

533
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
 Our fight is accident ... 

534
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,220
 We are behind us ... 

535
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,280
 We are ahead of us. 

536
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
 Be present, brothers. 

537
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,200
 You exist. 

538
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,820
 I was going to be from my heart a little more ... 

539
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,760
 Then you supported me so much, Ayşe Hatun. 

540
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,300
 You relieved my burden. 

541
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,860
 May Allah ease your burden. 

542
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
 God give healing. 

543
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,180
 Thank goodness he survived with that. 

544
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
 Thank you, don't be missing. 

545
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,880
 You've come all the way ... 

546
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,920
 God bless you. 

547
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,120
 Ayşe Hatun, very fond of us. 

548
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,640
 When the opportunity arises, they never miss. 

549
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,160
 They know they are loved, and I am Aygül from him. 

550
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,640
 Bring something to our guests. 

551
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,720
 Come on. 

552
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,180
 My father has many greetings for you ... 

553
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,540
 It is a prayer to your health. 

554
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,300
 God bless our Sheikh. 

555
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
 How happy he got his prayer. 

556
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,220
 May your Sheikh pray more ... 

557
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,040
 But our heads are not spared. 

558
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
 May Allah bring our end to good. 

559
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,980
 A young ant ... 

560
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,640
 He saw the pen write on paper ... 

561
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
 Go to this secret right away ... 

562
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,960
 He told another ant. 

563
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
 The pencil said it was a great artist. 

564
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,220
 I saw it with my eyes. 

565
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,440
 Sesame flowers on the paper ... 

566
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,420
 Rose petals embroidered. 

567
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,160
 The other ant stopped for a moment ... 

568
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,240
 It is not a pencil that is an artist ... 

569
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
 It is a finger. 

570
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,940
 In another ant listening to them ... 

571
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,380
 He entered the speech ... 

572
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,480
 What finger ... 

573
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,440
 What pen, that's the trick ... 

574
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,860
 He said it was on the arm. 

575
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,100
 The old ant listening to the conversation of these three ants ... 

576
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,460
 He could not resist that ... 

577
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,200
 This trick ... 

578
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
 He said not to copy it. 

579
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,860
 This is for business, finger ... 

580
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
 He said it wouldn't be strong. 

581
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,580
 You call power ... 

582
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,860
 When creature sleeps ... 

583
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,600
 He submits to a temporary death. 

584
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,500
 But the mind ... 

585
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,020
 He said he always lives. 

586
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,460
 Trick is not at the strength of the wrist, my akca. 

587
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,420
 It is mental. 

588
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,760
 Thank you, Sheikh. 

589
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
 There are some people ... 

590
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
 It is not possible to get out of the biceps. 

591
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,220
 There are some adversaries that ... 

592
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,460
 It is not eaten with pusat. 

593
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,720
 Alişar is one of them. 

594
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,280
 Against him... 

595
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,680
 Persistence with the idea and ... 

596
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
 We will fight with reason. 

597
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,400
 He wishes to have his house built with tiles. 

598
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,740
 Even the mindset ... 

599
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,380
 Get on the road. 

600
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,140
 Let's see his skill. 

601
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,620
 Gather intelligence, I'll flow. 

602
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,620
 Let's see... 

603
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,880
 One body ... 

604
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,820
 Alişar Bey with two faces ... 

605
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,220
 What games translate. 

606
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,660
 We are filled with the bite of the shroud ... 

607
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,140
 In the Muslim dorm ... 

608
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,140
 For those who pursue a sentence ... 

609
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
 We will not give an opportunity, my dear. 

610
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,560
 Blood in soil ... 

611
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,520
 This country, mixed with trouble ... 

612
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,080
 We will be the mind that cannot be received. 

613
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,680
 I was relieved. 

614
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,640
 Enjoy your meal, Selcan Hatun. 

615
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,700
 Whether healing. 

616
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,560
 Drink it, Bala Hatun. 

617
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,380
 No, you don't like it? 

618
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,480
 It was beautiful. 

619
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,340
 Aygül Hatun, whose hand tasted sherbet. 

620
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,840
 Informal medicine, ointment from this ... 

621
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
 Get whatever you need. 

622
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,940
 We find and send them with dervishes. 

623
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,520
 My mom makes every medicine. 

624
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
 If he did something to keep ticks away ... 

625
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,140
 We will be comfortable. 

626
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,520
 Aygul! 

627
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,700
 Isn't it true? 

628
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
 Did tick tick hold? 

629
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,960
 How is it possible to survive? 

630
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,460
 Your words are meaningful Aygül Hatun. 

631
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,600
 We understood that we will understand. 

632
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,060
 We were uncomfortable. 

633
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,420
 Estafurullah, my daughter. 

634
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,380
 Who are you to bother us? 

635
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,720
 Aygul! 

636
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,040
 You know very well who we are. 

637
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,280
 Since he knows, he can make our syrup trap water ... 

638
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,120
 You offer it like that. 

639
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,420
 Excuse us. 

640
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,460
 If there is a need, we are always ready to help. 

641
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,740
 Thank you, girl. 

642
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,020
 Shame! 

643
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,360
 You pity yourself. 

644
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,140
 May you take care of your daughter, Zöhre. 

645
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,360
 Otherwise a time will remain in my hands. 

646
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,620
 Bamsı Bey smelled the cenk. 

647
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,460
 Does it ever happen? 

648
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,000
 After all it's old spring. 

649
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,640
 Samsa Sergeant ... 

650
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,420
 Are the measures okay? 

651
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,060
 Okay, I'm Osman Bey. 

652
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,380
 Then.. 

653
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,760
 Appreciation belongs to Allah. 

654
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,000
 Siddiq. 

655
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,760
 In this war, your most important duty is yours. 

656
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,540
 But if you don't want to come ... 

657
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,640
 You know I can not pick you up. 

658
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,640
 Then every sword that I slash ... 

659
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,540
 It is atonement for my past sins. 

660
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
 Don't deprive me of this, Osman Bey. 

661
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,000
 Thank you. 

662
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,820
 their veins ... 

663
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,580
 Orhan ... 

664
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,800
 In the exuberant waters of the Caspian ... 

665
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
 My valiant comrades. 

666
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,820
 Freezing us with the curse of swear ... 

667
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,180
 With the embankments of the persecution ... 

668
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,100
 They want to stop us. 

669
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
 Now don't run like a waterfall ... 

670
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,220
 All the obstacles we face ... 

671
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,040
 It is time to demolish. 

672
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,260
 With sores in his bosom ... 

673
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,400
 The Prophet's 

674
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,240
 For the sake of doubt ... 

675
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,860
 Waiting for the justice of the Turk ... 

676
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,580
 Sentence for the sake of the oppressed ... 

677
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,240
 For the love of those who set up the game ... 

678
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,220
 Day... 

679
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,300
 The game of the cruel ... 

680
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,260
 It is the day of destruction per head! 

681
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,440
 Allahu akbar! 

682
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,380
 Is that all Satukalp? 

683
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,880
 In this narrow time, only so much, sir. 

684
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,300
 Don't worry, Osman said he will find the gold and he will find it. 

685
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,780
 Should we entrust the big oba to the word of an Osma? 

686
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,340
 Shall we wait with our hands tied? 

687
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,100
 Our hands are not tied ... 

688
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,740
 We also do not have to submit to what the coffee called Alişar said. 

689
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
 Let's find the poison in gold. 

690
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,440
 Stop Selcan Hatun. 

691
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,720
 After all, he is a Turkish gentleman. 

692
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,260
 If it is understood that we are doing this ... 

693
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,980
 We pull the Mongolian scourge on us. 

694
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,420
 What if Osman can't bring the gold? 

695
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,540
 Then... 

696
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,640
 Allah is Holy. 

697
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,220
 Guards always stop ahead ... 

698
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,580
 You go then ... 

699
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,380
 They missed you. 

700
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,220
 Traitor Salvador! 

701
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,720
 I hardly got rid of the Turks. 

702
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,100
 I came to the refuge. 

703
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,300
 Bey. 

704
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,240
 Shall we go? 

705
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,920
 Stop, brother. 

706
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,500
 Sıddık knows what to do. 

707
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,300
 Stop dead dead now. 

708
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,760
 You became a Muslim, Sıddık! 

709
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,340
 Osman Bey, when it comes out of the cover ... 

710
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,260
 There is a secret door to the treasure room. 

711
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,280
 Where does this go? 

712
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,860
 He goes to the taekwur room. 

713
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,340
 They did so that they could escape when there was a siege. 

714
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,460
 What did you not say from the beginning? 

715
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,680
 You go ahead, Bamsı Bey. 

716
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,960
 If he goes to the room of the taqwur. 

717
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,620
 Then I would like to say hi to Sophia. 

718
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,600
 I Uthman ... 

719
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,280
 Then I'll come with you. 

720
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,440
 Your duty is more important, Bamsı. 

721
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,140
 Take the gold and come. 

722
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,180
 We meet here. 

723
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,600
 Let me go ahead, there may be traps. 

724
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,100
 If there was a trap ... 

725
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,700
 Why didn't you tell Osman Bey? 

726
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,300
 There is no trap, there is a road to Tekfur. 

727
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,960
 We dreamed before me. 

728
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,180
 Alişar Bey 

729
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:44,340
 Welcome. 

730
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,780
 Princess Sophia is waiting for you. 

731
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,720
 This is the secret entrance to the treasure room. 

732
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,500
 Who do you have inside? 

733
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,900
 No one is in the room. 

734
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,060
 However, there are guards in front of the door. 

735
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,740
 How many guards? 

736
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,160
 It's hard to know there. 

737
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,280
 Ultimately, the treasure room of the big castle. 

738
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,300
 You're sure we're stuck, right? 

739
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,460
 As a treasure room ... 

740
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,380
 Do not take us to the dungeon of the castle. 

741
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,480
 I'm sure not. 

742
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,360
 I'm a child now, Bamsı Bey. 

743
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,360
 Die, I'll die. 

744
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,580
 You beat me with your bravery. 

745
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,740
 Exist. 

746
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,920
 May Allah make you a saint in both worlds. 

747
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,940
 Alişar Bey 

748
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,480
 Welcome. 

749
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,600
 Here you are. 

750
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,040
 While I escaped from the dungeon and saved my life hard ... 

751
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,640
 What are you doing? 

752
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,680
 Indeed, great courage. 

753
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,300
 You underestimate me, Sophia. 

754
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,960
 I am Alişar Bey. 

755
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,340
 I came to lay the foundations of an unshakable ally. 

756
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,420
 After he deceived all his slander? 

757
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,160
 Be quiet. 

758
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 His people are broken from misery ... 

759
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
 They float in gold. 

760
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,620
 The milk that your mother is breastfeeding is halal. 

761
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,980
 My lion. 

762
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,260
 Open the door. 

763
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,500
 Come on, valiant come on. 

764
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,280
 Open the door, thieves! 

765
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,360
 Come on, boys, don't waste time! 

766
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,340
 Let's move on. 

767
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,620
 We both know that all he said is true. 

768
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,120
 Knowing that, it shows that it takes everything. 

769
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,220
 Isn't it worth it? 

770
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,080
 Of course, Alişar Bey 

771
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,420
 But I am Byzantine ... 

772
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,760
 You are the flight of the Seljuks in the Mongol invasion. 

773
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,080
 Both of us will not be connected to anyone ... 

774
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,720
 We have passion, Sophia. 

775
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,920
 This is also a reality. 

776
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,040
 But before our alliance ... 

777
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,920
 There is an obstacle. 

778
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,580
 E.g? 

779
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,740
 For example, Kayılar. 

780
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,960
 For example, Edebalı. 

781
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,720
 You don't need to send another. 

782
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,320
 There are a lot more Siddik. 

783
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
 That's enough for me. 

784
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,840
 It's time to close the lid. 

785
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,340
 Siddiq! 

786
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,160
 What do you do? Open it! 

787
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,580
 Siddiq! 

788
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,660
 Turkish so far! 

789
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,240
 All of you will go, dirty Turks! 

790
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,080
 What did Osman and Bamsı Bey do to you? 

791
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,340
 You Turks are very naive. 

792
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,160
 Say hi to Osman Bey. 

793
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,480
 Although Kayılar dominates Söğüt ... 

794
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,640
 It's a simple oba that is ultimately connected to me. 

795
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,840
 As for Edebalı ... 

796
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,660
 I don't know why it scared you so much. 

797
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,480
 It is also in my market .... 

798
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,900
 A simple tradesman. 

799
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,080
 So. 

800
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,360
 You underestimate us Alişar Bey 

801
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,380
 Yeah... 

802
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,300
 Apricots are a simple oba. 

803
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,820
 However, the Turks in the extreme ... 

804
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,420
 They are the most famous warriors and they are constantly coming across. 

805
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,640
 If it is literary, the Turks are against us ... 

806
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,200
 A provocative decoy. 

807
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,520
 Ahilik is just a mask of trades. 

808
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,920
 If you want a strong alliance as you claim ... 

809
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,040
 You have to remove these two obstacles. 

810
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,920
 Literary and Ahis ... 

811
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,420
 I need it for my economic investments. 

812
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,720
 they Kayi ... 

813
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,040
 They are busy collecting the gold they stole from me. 

814
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,560
 Alişar Bey 

815
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,380
 So why don't the Mongols come? 

816
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,120
 I see that all kinds of weather ... 

817
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,980
 It is stolen to your ear. 

818
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,620
 Princess. 

819
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,180
 We have birds Alişar Bey 

820
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,740
 The greatest power you know is knowledge. 

821
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,640
 You're right, the Mongolian commander ... 

822
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,200
 And their brutal soldiers will be in Söğüt in the morning. 

823
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,700
 Then I'll see the Kayi stand up. 

824
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,000
 Alişar. 

825
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:18,500
 I drink to our partnership, Alişar Bey. 

826
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,500
 Mr. Bamsı! 

827
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,200
 Sidz closed the lid. 

828
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,360
 Traitor dog! 

829
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,400
 You shouldn't be Bamsı Bey. 

830
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,020
 Let's go out, Bamsı Bey. 

831
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
 Let the thesis go and open that cover. 

832
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,200
 We have to go, come on here. 

833
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,520
 Our alliance hopefully brings good luck to both of us. 

834
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,220
 I have no doubt about it. 

835
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
 Our togetherness will be very strong. 

836
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,520
 Let me accompany you to your room. 

837
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,780
 Princess... 

838
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,480
 Sorry. 

839
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,840
 But I will not be able to spend the night here. 

840
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,320
 I must arrive early in the morning tomorrow. 

841
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,100
 May my soldiers accompany you. 

842
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,620
 Goodnight Princess. 

843
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,960
 Goodnight. 

844
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,200
 Bamsı Bey is not like this cover will be opened. 

845
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,800
 Children, brave! 

846
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,420
 The day is the day of martyrdom. 

847
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,260
 Halal your right. 

848
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,260
 Good job. 

849
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,960
 Siblings. 

850
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,640
 I Usman. 

851
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,780
 I am Bamsı. 

852
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:17,980
 Hamsa Sergeant. 

853
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,100
 Hey, thank you. 

854
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,440
 Come on, valiant. 

855
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,560
 Stand up, valiant. 

856
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,920
 Who enters the treasure room! 

857
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,600
 Or the secret passage? 

858
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,320
 Salvador. 

859
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,280
 There can be no other than Salvador. 

860
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,280
 He took our gold with Osman. 

861
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,680
 Hamsa Sergeant. 

862
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,060
 let's 

863
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,020
 I Uthman ... 

864
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,880
 Salvador sold us. 

865
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,840
 Sıddık Sıddık is not. 

866
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,100
 Certainly, we will ask for an account, Bamsı Bey. 

867
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,660
 Hay! 

868
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,100
 Damn it! 

869
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,120
 Will we tell this to Alişar Bey? 

870
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,120
 To make fun of us? 

871
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,080
 Never! 

872
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,680
 This will not be known! 

873
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,740
 Think about them! 

874
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,280
 Then demolish the gate. 

875
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,280
 Don't let anyone get in again. 

876
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,980
 I knew all along. 

877
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,380
 Traitor dog! 

878
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,040
 How many chests do we have? 

879
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,400
 Three chests are missing, Samsa Bey. 

880
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,080
 There is enough for Alişar. 

881
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,060
 But the loot is short. 

882
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,520
 I was supposed to buy new tents in Oba. 

883
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,520
 No longer... 

884
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,900
 Another influx is Samsa Sergeant. 

885
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,620
 I will make you know from my share. 

886
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,900
 After all... 

887
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,060
 Samsa Sergeant obese ... 

888
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,120
 We are also our obese. 

889
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,720
 When from the tents ... 

890
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,540
 We will move to stone mansions ... 

891
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,200
 I think of him next to me. 

892
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,160
 The castle is here, brother. 

893
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,640
 Real Osman Osman ... 

894
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,640
 When will we conquer this castle? 

895
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,320
 I dream of conquering the Nikali Samsa Sergeant. 

896
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,540
 What is this place? 

897
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,000
 Its time will come. 

898
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,060
 He said I became a Muslim ... 

899
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,260
 He martyred ... 

900
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,720
 He gave me a tribute to be a child ... 

901
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,520
 Bamsı Bey played us. 

902
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,360
 But he will not stay with him. 

903
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,260
 I let go of my own child's killer. 

904
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,720
 You swallowed this trick too, Big Bamsi. 

905
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:50,000
 Shame on those white hair. 

906
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,640
 Well, there is no bad, Bamsı Bey. 

907
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,200
 The time will come. 

908
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,740
 Not that... 

909
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,100
 I have bad news for you ... 

910
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,120
 Hayrola sir? 

911
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,800
 Mongolians. 

912
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,040
 What happened to the Mongols, son? 

913
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,840
 I heard Sophia talking. 

914
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,400
 The Mongols will come to Söğüt. 

915
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,880
 After dealing with the Alşar issue, we will pass to Söğüt. 

916
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,060
 Let's see what were their intentions? 

917
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,500
 Princess Sophia. 

918
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:37,040
 Listen, princess Sophia. 

919
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,800
 Despicable dog. 

920
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,780
 Nothing is like your opinion. 

921
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,240
 Traitor! 

922
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,280
 You sold me in the mansion of Alşar ... 

923
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,500
 You told Osman the secret passages of the castle ... 

924
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,660
 You brought him to the treasure room. 

925
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,060
 The plans of the castle were in your hands. 

926
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,940
 How? 

927
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,580
 Answer the dog! 

928
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,040
 Edebali. 

929
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,720
 To save my life ... 

930
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,060
 I made them believe that I am a Muslim. 

931
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,460
 I infiltrated them. 

932
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,900
 I made them trust. 

933
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,560
 I had no other choice. 

934
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,960
 To master Yannis ... 

935
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
 I did not betray. 

936
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,040
 If I wanted to, I would kill your men and run away with gold ... 

937
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,220
 Is this true? 

938
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,220
 That's right, my princess. 

939
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,340
 He left us alive by pretending to have killed us. 

940
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,440
 He also delivered the gold. 

941
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,320
 They come, pretend to be dead. 

942
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,720
 How many you trust me now! 

943
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,600
 I am telling the truth about the name of our Mother Mary. 

944
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,700
 There is a lot to tell about Osman. 

945
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,900
 Am I ready to eat, sir? 

946
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,460
 A lonely room. 

947
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,640
 The biggest is the most beautiful. 

948
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,380
 Whatever you want, sir, follow me. 

949
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,480
 [They salute with a strange language] 

950
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,620
 Genghis Khan's shadow has not fallen ... 

951
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,020
 There will not be a single piece of land. 

952
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,300
 Spirited ... 

953
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,760
 He did not give back from the black earth ... 

954
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,140
 The honor of everything will be asked from us. 

955
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,380
 With Osman who broke their lives ... 

956
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,580
 Alps ... 

957
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,320
 Our landlords will also live forever. 

958
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,900
 Spiritless, meatless, humiliated .... 

959
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,320
 Tomorrow we will print all the oba ... 

960
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,680
 Suci from their blood ... 

961
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:59,860
 Drawing from skins ... 

962
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,940
 It is time to make jewelry from their honor. 

963
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,080
 Tomorrow is alone ... 

964
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,300
 I want Oba gentlemen ... 

965
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,140
 And Söğüt. 

966
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,940
 Remember every Turk ... 

967
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,080
 It pays 12 gold taxes. 

968
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,440
 Cutting the golden egg laying ... 

969
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,640
 It is folly. 

970
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,480
 Remember why you came here. 

971
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,260
 Entertainment ... 

972
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,940
 One more loot. 

973
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:41,580
 Fun and loot. 

974
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,060
 Mr. Alişar has fallen to the apricot, now sir. 

975
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,500
 I'll keep it in my palm. 

976
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:14,160
 As soon as I'm done ... 

977
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:16,800
 Instantly... 

978
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,260
 I Boğuca. 

979
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,400
 Sir Akçe dervish came, there are ahis. 

980
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,260
 Akçe dervish? 

981
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:07,980
 Akçe Derviş? 

982
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,760
 What's up? 

983
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,520
 What brought you to Alişar Bey's mansion? 

984
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,640
 Our Sheikh commanded. 

985
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:19,260
 Alişar Bey asked his mansion to process the tiles. 

986
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,740
 I came to examine. 

987
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,060
 Go ahead. 

988
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,180
 Time's up, Dundar Bey. 

989
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
 Where are my golds? 

990
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,840
 Oba beech ... 

991
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,100
 But your judgment is yours, Alişar Bey. 

992
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:23,620
 Keep calm. 

993
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,760
 I will tell you everything. 

994
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:36,420
 Akçe Derviş ... 

995
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,200
 You go without notice. 

996
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,800
 You will take this gift to Sheikh Edebalı, one of our Alişar Beys. 

997
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,180
 Thank you. 

998
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,620
 What happens here? 

999
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:48,580
 Speak now. 

1000
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:52,060
 I'll listen to you. 

1001
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:58,000
 We could not collect enough gold Alişar Bey 

1002
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,160
 However, I destroyed all the economics books. 

1003
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:06,840
 How much time we have, weaving ... 

1004
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,120
 We are ready to give. 

1005
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,580
 What shall I do for your stinking weaving? 

1006
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:17,540
 My gold skin is Dundar Bey! 

1007
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,740
 Gold! 

1008
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:24,500
 Didn't I say I will come with my fire, burn your oban? 

1009
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,480
 Who will prevent me now? 

1010
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,960
 If I plant the piles in the middle of the oba ... 

1011
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:35,260
 If I pass your alps! 

1012
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,780
 You alive ... 

1013
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,180
 If I throw it in boiling boilers ... 

1014
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,620
 If I take your lungs out with my hands ... 

1015
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:48,260
 Who will prevent mankind! 

1016
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,960
 Who! 

1017
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,540
 Osman. 

1018
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,800
 Alişar Bey 

1019
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,900
 Your gold is outside. 

1020
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,560
 Now let my obedient leave. 

1021
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,780
 Where do you go before I say go? 

1022
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,360
 I kept my promise... 

1023
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,240
 I don't get any hijack from anyone to go. 

1024
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,240
 I'm not anyone, Osman. 

1025
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,620
 I'm the Sancak Bey. 

1026
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,640
 Are you going to stop? 

1027
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,080
 Did I say stop at this end ... 

1028
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,900
 Rain diner wind stops. 

1029
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,660
 You will stop, Osman! 

1030
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,460
 Stop if you can afford it! 

1031
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,140
 Do not go crazy. 

1032
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:03,980
 Osman 

1033
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,760
 From now on... 

1034
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:19,820
 Where I am ... 

1035
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,180
 You have no judgment, Alişar Bey. 

1036
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,680
 You weren't going to break the command of your brain, Osman! 

1037
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,640
 You can not be beylik ... 

1038
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,880
 Absorb it. 

1039
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,880
 Take that Osman, speak like a man. 

1040
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,100
 Or... 

1041
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:57,260
 The end of this work is blood. 

1042
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,280
 Nothing will be the same anymore. 

1043
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,960
 You know. 

1044
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,580
 What does this Alişar mean? 

1045
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,160
 A big trouble is coming, son. 

1046
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,360
 It's a huge trouble. 

1047
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:37,580
 Day... 

1048
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:42,240
 It is the day of carving the honeybee from fire. 

1049
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,620
 Day... 

1050
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,980
 Ancestors in their souls ... 

1051
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:52,000
 It is the victim day. 

1052
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,200
 Day... 

1053
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,340
 From the sun ... 

1054
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:02,500
 It is a day of mighty light. 

1055
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,380
 Day... 

1056
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,760
 The name of the Turks ... 

1057
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:14,440
 Joy of life ... 

1058
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,920
 The power ... 

1059
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:20,380
 Faith ... 

1060
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,800
 It is the day of taking away. 

1061
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,180
 Day... 

1062
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:31,540
 With the clean blood of Genghis Khan ... 

1063
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:35,180
 Meat covered in bone ... 

1064
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,840
 It is the day of the Balgay! 

1065
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,920
 Now... 

1066
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,320
 You go everywhere ... 

1067
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,560
 Say the word of the whale. 

1068
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:55,900
 To this land ... 

1069
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:59,600
 Sculptures from under my and my nomads ... 

1070
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,940
 I came to get enough tax to make. 

1071
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:12,380
 Or your children ... 

1072
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:15,940
 Avratlar your ... 

1073
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,680
 You C ... 

1074
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,120
 If you know this like this. 

1075
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:51,600
 Osman Osman, you would run to Zöhre. 

1076
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,700
 How he brought the gold. 

1077
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,840
 Osman shows us the past first ... 

1078
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,900
 Then he agrees with the disease. 

1079
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,460
 Is it ingenious? 

1080
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,080
 It's ingenuity. 

1081
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,100
 Consider what we would do without Osman. 

1082
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,160
 Babes stop beating. 

1083
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,160
 Thank god... 

1084
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,180
 We've survived this trouble. 

1085
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,280
 Thank god. 

1086
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,520
 What are these sounds? 

1087
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,560
 Father. 

1088
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,920
 Mongolians. 

1089
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:38,340
 So that's what Alişar meant. 

1090
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:59,220
 Cengiz in the flight ... 

1091
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:01,860
 Under the ground ... 

1092
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,360
 To the souls in the skin of the sky ... 

1093
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,680
 You swear if you resist ... 

1094
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:10,600
 I'll mow until your honey in the cradle. 

1095
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:20,620
 This tip is now Balgay, Mongolian's iron fist. 

1096
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:26,400
 Willow is the right to pusat of the apricot. 

1097
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,220
 The right of the head lift is pusat. 

1098
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,020
 To you the Mongolian warlords ... 

1099
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,340
 I brought his inexhaustible anger. 

1100
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:34,540
 Dündar! 

1101
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:38,160
 Not the tip of you ... 

1102
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:40,980
 Not even a shepherd's head. 

1103
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,580
 With Yeğenin Gündüz ... 

1104
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,520
 You will come before Commander Balgay. 

1105
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:17,480
 We brought the gentlemen who paid their taxes little. 

1106
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,680
 Aren't we going to join the fun, Commander Balgay? 

1107
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:57,160
 Fun for me ... 

1108
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:01,840
 It will start when it falls before me. 

1109
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,420
 Zöhre! 

1110
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,400
 With the soul on the ground and in the sky ... 

1111
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,640
 He gave us everything. 

1112
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:40,580
 One of us ... 

1113
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:42,880
 No mercy. 

1114
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:54,740
 Take it! 

1115
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:58,500
 The alps that haunted the soldiers from the happy blood of Cengiz ... 

1116
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,460
 Your courage kept my eyes. 

1117
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:03,320
 We heard that ... 

1118
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:09,080
 Kayılar has forgotten both the name and name of the Mongols in Söğüt ... 

1119
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:12,780
 We have come to remind you who has the judgment. 

1120
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:15,140
 Drown dog in Cengiz's blood! 

1121
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,800
 Kill all the alps. 

1122
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,380
 The Mongols have come, sir. 

1123
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,080
 Where do you run? 

1124
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:06,140
 Is it okay to escape from death? 

1125
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:09,100
 They escape like a headless sheep. 

1126
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:13,540
 Samsa Sergeant either deal with the state or raven carcass. 

1127
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:19,640
 Let us remind them that the Turk is not headless. 

1128
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,280
 How long have I not shed Mongolian blood ... 

1129
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:30,040
 There is a fest, I'm Bamsı. 

1130
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,160
 Come on, God! 

1131
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,040
 The flag is a Turk's freedom engagement. 

1132
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:21,200
 Tongue extender's tongue ... 

1133
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,320
 We cut the hand of the person who stretches it. 

1134
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,980
 Ertuğurul Gazi's son Osman is the word. 

1135
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,400
 Keep in mind. 

1136
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,080
 Mr. Osman. 

1137
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:17,140
 [Pray in Mongolian] 

1138
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,140
 It will rain like rain ... 

1139
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,200
 Gentlemen of the Turks ... 

1140
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:47,460
 They will fall on my feet and close. 

1141
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:23,380
 Kill them all! 

1142
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,320
 Balgay. 

1143
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,520
 With the Osman alps ... 

1144
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:42,680
 He stood against our soldiers ... 

1145
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:45,920
 My neighbors shed his blood. 

1146
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
 Wow wow wow Osman. 

1147
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:55,680
 Our early smell. 

1148
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,440
 Hunting came to our feet. 

1149
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,500
 Bring a thesis here. 

1150
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,140
 Osman Bey waits for the Balgay Inn. 

1151
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:30,840
 If you resist, do not pity. 

1152
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:33,940
 I Uthman ... 

1153
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:37,060
 What does this Mongolian scum want from you? 

1154
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:41,140
 Let's see what Balgay's abdominal pain was. 

1155
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,440
 Download your pusat Osman Bey. 

1156
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,480
 With the Alps. 

1157
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,280
 Osman said. 

1158
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:16,040
 The gold of Alishar dog ... 

1159
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:17,940
 It was income from Konya. 

1160
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:20,080
 When we pressed the caravanserai, the gold we received ... 

1161
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:22,480
 His real traitor was determined, Bamsı Bey. 

1162
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,980
 They took back the gold. 

1163
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:30,580
 But the hives that we conceived were of Balgay. 

1164
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,480
 We got it. 

1165
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,440
 What gold or military? 

1166
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:38,620
 Balgay's problem is different. 

1167
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:44,440
 Did you press Kervansaray ... 

1168
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:47,180
 Everyone has learned who Alişar is ... 

1169
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:51,100
 This was what Osman wanted. 

1170
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:55,540
 May Allah grant us an honorable worship to all of us, Bamsı Bey. 

1171
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:03,940
 May Allah not let us die without killing three or five of these. 

1172
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:07,520
 Amine. 

1173
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:10,360
 Thank you, son. 

1174
02:09:31,620 --> 02:09:32,700
 Sit down. 

1175
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,760
 They say the fish smells from the beginning ... 

1176
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,500
 Wrestler superior to wrestler ... 

1177
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:03,380
 There is a man superior to man. 

1178
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:07,420
 The multitude of our enemies ... 

1179
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:10,040
 Balgay is from our manhood. 

1180
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,940
 Your grandfather Süleyman Şah ... 

1181
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,960
 Your father is Ertuğurul Gazi. 

1182
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:19,720
 Now you. 

1183
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,440
 Secelem goes to Oğuz Kaan. 

1184
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,260
 If you try to count, your life is not enough. 

1185
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:35,560
 If I try to kill you ... 

1186
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:38,040
 For those who hold pusat for me ... 

1187
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,720
 A neutral that I desire to be the best ... 

1188
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,660
 I would have spent. 

1189
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:45,940
 If I try to buy you ... 

1190
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:49,820
 The treasures of Genghis Khan are not enough. 

1191
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:53,660
 Then... 

1192
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:57,520
 Let me get your head on my pusat. 

1193
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:00,820
 For me... 

1194
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:03,780
 So many heads you will get ... 

1195
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:06,640
 So many wars you will enter ... 

1196
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,420
 With dozens of castles to conquer ... 

1197
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,980
 What is Balgay's head? 

1198
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:21,220
 I remember you well, I came, Osman Bey. 

1199
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:28,080
 What do you think you would buy me with? 

1200
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:31,160
 Contents ... 

1201
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,720
 As high as Tengri mountain ... 

1202
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:36,700
 His great ambition as much as the Gobi desert ... 

1203
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:41,660
 Even by. 

1204
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:54,720
 Well ... 

1205
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:58,980
 It keeps playing in the mouth of the tongue ... 

1206
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:02,480
 What do you like? 

1207
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:05,620
 Listen to me, Osman Bey. 

1208
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:10,360
 Out to your brothers and sisters ... 

1209
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:15,740
 I promise to die. 

1210
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:21,220
 Whether with my pus ... 

1211
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,500
 Whether by fighting. 

1212
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,520
 Die with my pusat ... 

1213
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:31,580
 Or be my Sancak Bey. 

1214
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:34,440
 Vibrate the world.

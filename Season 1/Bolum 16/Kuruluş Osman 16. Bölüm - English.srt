1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:02:03,280
 [Generic] 

2
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,680
 To me... 

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,980
 ... for my life ... 

4
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,640
 ... you offered starboard principality. 

5
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,740
 Me too 

6
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,660
 I promise an honored death, Balgay. 

7
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,300
 Commander Balgay ... 

8
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,140
 ... How did Osman know that we would come here? 

9
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,900
 Before you cut your tongue ... 

10
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,320
 I will learn it, Kongar. 

11
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,780
 The fear that you are putting sentence into your world with your pusat ... 

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,220
 ... let it be in my heart. 

13
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,620
 Your... 

14
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,340
 .... I will dismantle your heart Osman. 

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,260
 They NOK ... 

16
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,860
 ... be ready to die. 

17
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,540
 For Erlik Han! 

18
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,200
 Come on! 

19
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,400
 My father and father's soul will be chagrin today, Kongar. 

20
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,820
 Black steel self sword. 

21
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,900
 Get off guard. 

22
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,580
 Trap huh! 

23
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,920
 You quickly forgot the hatred of Mongolian, Samsa. 

24
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,320
 Balgay will also ask you for this. 

25
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,220
 Balgay now save himself from the grip of Osman Bey. 

26
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,240
 Cerkutay, you worry. 

27
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,280
 You Cerkutay you. 

28
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:00,265
 Çetin Alp ... 

29
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:04,825
 ... take two alps with you. 

30
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,295
 Follow this push to the hole it enters. 

31
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,200
 Put that hole on your head too. 

32
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,820
 There should have been more men next to Cerkutay. 

33
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,840
 Obviously, the pits are next to Balgay. 

34
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,200
 Come on we have to run to help Osman Bey. 

35
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,475
 If I go to my bed without drying the line of Kayılar ... 

36
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:34,135
 ... let me be roasted in Erlik Han's fire. 

37
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,740
 I'll be hell. 

38
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,240
 Osman! 

39
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,900
 I came to take your life, Osman. 

40
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,300
 I came to take your life. 

41
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,480
 What? 

42
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,520
 You're coming, Osman. 

43
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,420
 What is that? 

44
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,015
 Dad, did you rejoice tomorrow Osman? 

45
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,500
 You killed my child, my Batur, Osman. 

46
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,180
 On the floor of our Süleyman Shah ... 

47
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,500
 ... you infected your sister blood. 

48
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,540
 Let him drown in your blood. 

49
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,180
 Die! 

50
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,500
 What would you say if you saw me? 

51
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,380
 My arm, my wing is broken. 

52
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,760
 I light up my eyes. 

53
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,935
 If you see me ... 

54
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
 ... would you say the moment last? 

55
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,000
 How can you bear this pain, baby? 

56
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,200
 Ah, if you hadn't gone after Gündüz. 

57
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,140
 Even if my tongue broke ... 

58
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,300
 ... I did it to protect it, baby. 

59
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,960
 Can i break you 

60
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,000
 I wanted to protect it. 

61
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,380
 I wanted to watch it. 

62
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,860
 My lung is burning baby. 

63
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,240
 My mind does not take memory. 

64
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,980
 Osman, will Batur ever break my brother? 

65
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
 There is no evidence, no witness. 

66
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
 Aygul ... 

67
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,440
 ... don't you know Osman? 

68
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,000
 He killed his brother. 

69
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,860
 Is your heart still burning for him? 

70
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
 HE? 

71
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,360
 So your heart is rot, Aygül. 

72
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,280
 Your heart is rotten. 

73
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,120
 It was like this when he was catching up. 

74
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
 He would blow his mind like he was crazy. 

75
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,620
 Neither father nor Dundar could restrain. 

76
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,320
 I said it will bring us to an end, but I couldn't listen. 

77
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
 I did not listen. 

78
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,800
 What happened to my puppy. 

79
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,560
 The BAMS ... 

80
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,700
 ... Abdurrahman, Day of Selcan the ... 

81
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,980
 they all stood behind. 

82
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
 They didn't make a word. 

83
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
 They did not put dust. 

84
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,520
 Finally, they took my son to life. 

85
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,700
 But they always protected Osman. 

86
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,860
 Is there a destruction, Zöhre Hatun? 

87
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,500
 You're coming. 

88
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,460
 Next to Selcan Hatun, they loaded their horses with Gonca Hatun. 

89
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,580
 They leave the camp. 

90
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,720
 Is that so? 

91
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,000
 Wow Selcan Hatun wow. 

92
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,720
 Without bleeding like blood ... 

93
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,800
 .... put my son on his grave is a haram for me. 

94
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,520
 Mother... 

95
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,660
 ... let me be your victim. 

96
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,600
 Talk. 

97
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,540
 Get up your pusat. 

98
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,500
 They caused my Batur. 

99
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,040
 They will drown in the blood of Elbet. 

100
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,820
 That shallow will give my son's account. 

101
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
 The blood of my Batur ... 

102
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
 ... I'll take it with the sword of my Batur. 

103
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
 Mother... 

104
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,000
 Selcan Hatun has alps. 

105
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,100
 They won't leave us. 

106
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,880
 Don't let your eyes go. 

107
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,940
 Don't we have alps? 

108
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,720
 Go, tell the alps. 

109
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,960
 Get the horses ready. We'll go after them. 

110
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,300
 Mother... 

111
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,720
 I said, wearing your pusat. 

112
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,440
 My heart does not cool until he vomits blood in that area. 

113
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,720
 Let's. 

114
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
 Samsa. 

115
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,220
 Come on, valiant! 

116
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,580
 Shoot, don't be brave! 

117
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,080
 You will go, Osman. 

118
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,620
 You survived again. 

119
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,860
 Osman... 

120
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,980
 ... the blood ... 

121
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,000
 ... drown, Osman. 

122
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
 Osman. 

123
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,005
 Genghis Khan says ... 

124
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,075
 ... is a fool who fights even to be defeated. 

125
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,440
 Walk. 

126
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 Thread ... 

127
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,220
 ... follow Basgay. 

128
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,720
 I want them both dead or alive. Come on! 

129
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,600
 Emmi. 

130
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,760
 Emmi. 

131
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,780
 I'm Dundar Bey. 

132
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,840
 Osman... 

133
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
 ... a must ... 

134
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,600
 ... your death will be my best. 

135
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,020
 Not that... 

136
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,620
 Dundar Bey is dead. 

137
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,740
 Melik Shouldn't Die. 

138
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,080
 He should die. 

139
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,760
 Dundar need me. 

140
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,500
 We will not take our eyes off them. 

141
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
 Osman. 

142
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,820
 Osman. 

143
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
 When the time comes ... 

144
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,280
 ... I'll smash you with my hands. 

145
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,840
 If Zöhre Hatun heard that we were leaving the camp ... 

146
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,560
 ... followed us. 

147
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,780
 Kurgan Valley is little left. 

148
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,580
 If he has the future, he also has a vision. 

149
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,460
 Let's. 

150
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,820
 Non-stop. 

151
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,800
 We will continue on the road. 

152
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,620
 They go to the Kurgan Valley. 

153
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
 We will come before them. 

154
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
 Mother... 

155
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,700
 Let's not come back. 

156
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,280
 We left my brother on the ground. 

157
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,400
 You go back. 

158
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,960
 I'm chasing my boy's revenge. 

159
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,520
 I won't leave without getting hurt. 

160
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,460
 Now... 

161
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,840
 ... you should listen to me well. 

162
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,720
 After that, we will take the road with our pusat. 

163
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,560
 Selcan Hatun, my son ... 

164
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,055
 ... Osman, the murderer of your Batur Bey ... 

165
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,480
 ... it is a stooge. 

166
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,040
 The day is the account day. 

167
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,960
 There is no return to the oba without breathing. 

168
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:33,965
 Let's! 

169
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,300
 They're after us, Commander Balgay. 

170
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,780
 You're hurt, we need to lose track. 

171
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 Warm water... 

172
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,100
 ... erases our mark, not our anger. 

173
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,420
 They went into the water to lose their marks, brother. 

174
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,300
 There is no stopping until I find the place they came from, my Boran. 

175
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,760
 Let's be on the road. 

176
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 My brother... 

177
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,940
 ... when you find them, you will leave Kongar to me. 

178
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,500
 For what? 

179
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,380
 Do you think I will dive and comply with it again? 

180
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,860
 This time, I know that your eyes will not look at your age. 

181
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,640
 But I don't want you to find your hand in sister blood. 

182
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,380
 He's not my brother. 

183
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,700
 My father, who he read on his back, 

184
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,720
 ... the blood of the mother, whom they do not spoil, is in favor of her water and her blood is halal. 

185
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,940
 Thank you bro. 

186
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,540
 Well ... 

187
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,940
 What happened to Batur? 

188
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,760
 HE? 

189
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
 What happened to Batur? 

190
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,540
 You ask as if you don't know. 

191
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,540
 He killed Batur ... 

192
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,000
 You sent your body to the oba. 

193
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,220
 What more do you ask? 

194
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
 What does my Osman say? 

195
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,320
 I do not understand. 

196
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,380
 I don't understand, Bamsı Bey, but ... 

197
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:25,355
 We will understand. Now important is Dündar Bey. 

198
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,600
 He is alive and important to say. 

199
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,280
 The punishment he saw is not over. 

200
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,460
 Sencer is also alive. 

201
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,760
 Let Abdurrahman Gazi, Erkut and Kılıç come with you. 

202
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
 Dündar Bey and these two ... 

203
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,860
 ... take her to Elif. 

204
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,300
 The cave is at the bottom of the falcon rocks. 

205
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,780
 We arrive at the thesis time. 

206
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 Not that... 

207
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,660
 ... my absorption must live. 

208
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,540
 You understand? 

209
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,240
 Don't worry, Osman. 

210
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,060
 It is the same push that kills Batur and puts Dundar Bey behind us. 

211
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,340
 This is anyone who t ... 

212
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,080
 ... we can learn it from Dündar Bey. 

213
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,120
 Let's prepare the sled. 

214
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,840
 This is yours, sir. 

215
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,580
 Come here. Come here. 

216
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,240
 Who said we're here? 

217
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,060
 Who? 

218
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,840
 Talk! 

219
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
 Talk! 

220
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,640
 He said someone I had never seen before. 

221
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,360
 Who sent you? 

222
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
 Balgay sent Dundar Bey. 

223
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,460
 What prompts? 

224
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,660
 Balgay ... 

225
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,320
 ... has found the trace of Osman. 

226
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,160
 It is on the Wolf Hill. 

227
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 He calls you. 

228
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,640
 Who sent Dündar Bey ... 

229
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,880
 ... you are not Balgay, do you think Osman? 

230
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,720
 Then who sent Dundar here after Balgay? 

231
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,700
 Samsa Bey sent the gunner to Dündar Bey. 

232
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
 Obviously... 

233
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,840
 ... someone will do their best to make us suck each other with my absorption. 

234
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,600
 This is not Balgay. 

235
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:00,955
 It's not Yannez. 

236
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,700
 We will sooner or later find out who this traitor is. 

237
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,440
 De Osman ... 

238
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,240
 ... how do we find it? 

239
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,000
 We will go to Oba. 

240
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,120
 We will take back my father's trust. 

241
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,820
 So far, Kayı obas has not been headless. 

242
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
 It will not stay after that either. 

243
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,200
 Chewing our ceremony and ... 

244
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,860
 ... crap and ... 

245
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,220
 ... win wells behind us ... 

246
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,960
 ... we will not stop without asking for his account. 

247
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,480
 Hey, thank God. 

248
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,060
 Allahu akbar! 

249
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,880
 Allahu akbar! 

250
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,620
 Allahu akbar! 

251
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,780
 Allahu akbar! 

252
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,640
 Come on, there is no room for fear Gonca. 

253
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
 My concern is for you, Selcan Hatun. 

254
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
 I must protect you. 

255
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,280
 I'm my old land girl. 

256
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,160
 I don't sleep without knowing my pusat. 

257
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,360
 I do not set out I do not know the end. 

258
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,600
 You keep your heart fresh. Come on. 

259
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,820
 Let the blood flow to the water ... 

260
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,140
 ... Kayılar's blood ... 

261
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,700
 ... will flow like this stream. 

262
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,300
 Let the flying bird swear ... 

263
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,540
 ... Kayılar's head will fly like this. 

264
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,800
 Let the land be sworn to earth ... 

265
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
 ... black earth ... 

266
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,760
 There will be kills. 

267
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,240
 How did Osman trap us, Commander Balgay? 

268
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,300
 Do not you still understand? 

269
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,600
 One with Yannez ... 

270
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,280
 they brought us into a trap. 

271
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,660
 Snake was so insidious ... 

272
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,360
 ... a fox would be so crafty. 

273
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,940
 With a toy boy ... 

274
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,940
 ... an old booger ... 

275
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,600
 ... brought me to the game. 

276
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,160
 You promised Yannez more than he deserved. 

277
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,700
 Why did Yannez betray you? 

278
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,160
 My Promise ... 

279
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,060
 ... touching Osman's pusat ... 

280
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,800
 Kongar, who was chopped by lime. 

281
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,560
 First of ... 

282
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,800
 Let's find a cave and take refuge. 

283
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,320
 Let's strengthen our wounds. 

284
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,780
 That Balgay was not defeated ... 

285
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,380
 Osman will learn. 

286
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,560
 Were you able to locate Sofia? 

287
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,780
 We're still looking, sir. 

288
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,020
 If you can't find Sofia ... 

289
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,060
 ... you must know what will happen to you. 

290
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,800
 Yes sir. 

291
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,100
 I know. 

292
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,880
 No. 

293
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,120
 You can't imagine what I would do to you. 

294
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,020
 Sir... 

295
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,040
 ... we have no place to look at. 

296
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,920
 The place was almost split. 

297
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,740
 Cut! 

298
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,280
 Osman... 

299
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,320
 ... could he kill Balgay? 

300
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,340
 There are many Mongol dead on the Wolf Hill and in Inegol borders. 

301
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,900
 However, Balgay is not among them. 

302
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,180
 If Osman kidnapped Balgay from his hand ... 

303
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,880
 ... Mongols make us pay for this job. 

304
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,780
 We came to Osman's game. 

305
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,060
 I'm afraid this trap we fell ... 

306
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,120
 ... it will be our apocalypse. 

307
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,300
 Arm yourself ... 

308
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,840
 ... Zöhre Hatun. 

309
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,480
 No, Zöhre? 

310
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,500
 Did you come to Çapula ... 

311
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,740
 ... are you caring for bandit? 

312
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,500
 Osman killed my child. 

313
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,980
 You got her a dish. 

314
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,200
 You're gonna pay, chick. 

315
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,120
 Your battalion ate my Batur's head. 

316
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,440
 Aha, I thought you had a little mind. 

317
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,660
 Now in the fire of the mother ... 

318
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,740
 ... do you burn? 

319
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,960
 My place is next to my mother. 

320
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,520
 Do you think I would put my brother's blood on the floor? 

321
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,960
 Understood. 

322
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,960
 You will not feel comfortable without pouring Kaan. 

323
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,020
 Selcan Hatun will be my best. 

324
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,740
 Leave your pusat Selcan Hatun. 

325
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,300
 Now... 

326
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,520
 Osman, whom you love so much, come and save you. 

327
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,880
 A look we wanted ... 

328
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,200
 Allah gave two eyes. 

329
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
 We are confident that what we say you are pregnant. 

330
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,740
 Such a fairer strike would be Zöhre Hatun. 

331
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,020
 Come on, alps. 

332
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,080
 Ya Allah! 

333
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,900
 He will treat his aides with Dündar Bey. 

334
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,580
 Osman violated Balgay and saw my account. 

335
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,900
 Now, I have saved Dündar from their hands and ... 

336
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,240
 ... I will fuck that Balgay has failed. 

337
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,060
 I will finish Osman's job. 

338
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,620
 Dundar and Kayılar will be in my palms. 

339
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,160
 You will tell about the network of betrayal that you have set up, Zöhre. 

340
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,620
 Nothing's done yet, chick. 

341
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,840
 Dündar Bey will ask for their account. 

342
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,040
 Dündar Bey drowned in his betrayal. 

343
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,060
 Eceli has been my best Zöhre Hatun. 

344
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
 Father. 

345
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,260
 Dündar. 

346
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,180
 My son ... 

347
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,500
 ... you killed the man, Osman. 

348
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,940
 Dundar Bey and Batur ... 

349
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,500
 ... hand in hand with Balgay ... 

350
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,760
 ... collaborated with Mongolian. 

351
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,340
 They betrayed Kayılar. 

352
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,140
 I... 

353
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,980
 ... do you think I will keep the traitors alive? 

354
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,640
 The lord of our obese ... 

355
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,640
 ... is still my father. 

356
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,200
 No power can break our ceremony and ... 

357
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,240
 ... cannot choose our brain. 

358
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,640
 Announce the sentence world. 

359
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,680
 The death of Dündar Bey ... 

360
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,740
 ... it was my hand. 

361
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,880
 Join. 

362
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,400
 You will take Zöhre Hatun to the oba. 

363
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,980
 Throw it into the caged tent. 

364
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,880
 I haven't finished my account with him yet. 

365
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,180
 bırak.bırak. 

366
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,960
 You will find trouble, Osman. You will find trouble. 

367
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,800
 You killed my father and my brother. 

368
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,480
 Murderer. Shame on you. 

369
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,440
 Shame on you. 

370
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,600
 Shame on you. 

371
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,700
 Put Aygül next to his mother. 

372
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,620
 Zülfikar Derviş take my brother to the oba. 

373
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,260
 Thank you. 

374
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,720
 Now you will listen to me well. 

375
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,720
 Abdurrahman Gazi ... 

376
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,320
 ... Dundar Bey ... 

377
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,220
 Its condition is bad. It is necessary to brand the wound to stop bleeding. 

378
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,440
 Thesis, fire. 

379
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,960
 But first, it is necessary to remove the arrow. 

380
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,120
 Dagger. 

381
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,420
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

382
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

383
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
 Ya Shafi. 

384
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,120
 Shall we attack, sir? 

385
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,760
 Six people. 

386
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,900
 Three of them are injured. 

387
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,520
 If you give destur ... 

388
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,100
 ... it is the right time, sir. 

389
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,380
 You don't know Abdurrahman Gazi. 

390
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,580
 Do not look at his beard bleaching. 

391
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,200
 Ya Shafi. 

392
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,900
 Did you say Cenk ... 

393
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,120
 ... turns into a dragon. 

394
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,520
 Melik, notify the scouts. 

395
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,160
 May they come with skilled clashes in the pusat business. 

396
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,240
 Overbearing... 

397
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
 ... don't take your eyes off them. 

398
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,760
 Will it be good, Abdurrahman Gazi? 

399
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
 God willing. 

400
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
 But bleeding is very high. 

401
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,660
 We need to get up now. 

402
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,800
 Ya Shafi. 

403
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,440
 Ya Shafi. 

404
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,000
 Ya Shafi. 

405
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,580
 Cerkutay. 

406
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,460
 Balgay, you're hurt. 

407
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
 Osman secured his job. 

408
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,700
 If we could pass the Wolf Hill ... 

409
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,840
 ... we were again dominant. 

410
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,420
 How dares Osman Osman, Balgay? 

411
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,200
 Our adversary ... 

412
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,760
 ... we underestimated. 

413
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,080
 May this blood be flowing ... 

414
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,420
 ... to this burning fire ... 

415
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,760
 ... swear that ... 

416
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,440
 ... my revenge will be tough. 

417
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,540
 How Osman Osman made this ambush Balgay? 

418
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,220
 Yannez ... 

419
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,920
 ...obviously... 

420
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,860
 ... that crap has forgotten the wrath of Mongolian. 

421
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,540
 If he hadn't done business with Osman ... 

422
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,660
 ... it's not us who bleed ... 

423
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,420
 Osman would be. 

424
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,480
 We don't have a neighbor, Commander Balgay. 

425
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,960
 What will we do if Geyhatu hears this? 

426
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,580
 This is now ... 

427
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,540
 ... is my war. 

428
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,920
 If it comes across ... 

429
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,480
 I will kill Geyhatu. 

430
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,600
 We will arrive in Konya. 

431
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,120
 You can buy new posts ... 

432
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,800
 ... we'll be back. 

433
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,180
 When we return ... 

434
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,160
 ... will not be left with a head on the shoulder. 

435
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,620
 In this tip ... 

436
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,100
 ... sentence creature ... 

437
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,500
 ... I'm gonna burn it alive. 

438
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 As a child ... 

439
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,220
 ... man's father is the strongest in the world ... 

440
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,900
 ... he thinks he is the most invincible. 

441
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,500
 When he grew up like his father ... 

442
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,480
 ... will do everything ... 

443
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,760
 ... he thinks he will defeat everyone. 

444
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,080
 Passing through the war with nice enemies ... 

445
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,160
 ... you are helpless in the face of a rose face. 

446
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,480
 Thank God I saw these days. 

447
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,920
 Waits for the bud. 

448
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,900
 I'll go to a side. 

449
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,620
 OK, girl. 

450
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,700
 I know you have a load of mountains on your back, Osman. 

451
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,480
 Your every moment is yours. 

452
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,540
 Not that... 

453
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,800
 ... this is not it. 

454
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,160
 You have another situation. 

455
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,960
 Say, well. 

456
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,020
 Has. 

457
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,300
 There are the main. 

458
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,220
 What? 

459
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,400
 My pain is Bala. 

460
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,680
 What happened to Bala? 

461
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,540
 Changed. 

462
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,500
 Something else has happened. 

463
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,640
 He says no to you. 

464
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,100
 Another chick says to her. 

465
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,800
 Does Bala say that? 

466
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,820
 Oh. 

467
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,080
 Says Bala. 

468
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,460
 I put my heart in my mansion ... 

469
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,640
 ... Bala der Ana, whose path I disregarded. 

470
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,200
 Why son? Why does he say that? 

471
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,440
 I will look for the answer to this question. 

472
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,000
 I insisted so much. 

473
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,160
 I went over it, but ... 

474
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,940
 ... but it does not say. 

475
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,640
 There is something. 

476
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,500
 But it does not say. 

477
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,360
 You learn. 

478
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,060
 You'll tell me when you learn. 

479
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,480
 If the... 

480
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,840
 ... thank you for a justified reason. 

481
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,800
 If my heart passed Osman, 

482
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,400
 ... thank you. 

483
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,020
 Abdurrahman Gazi ... 

484
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,860
 ... why did you do this to me? 

485
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,380
 Actually, you owe it to our ob ... 

486
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,400
 .... How did you do to Ertuğrul Bey? 

487
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,460
 A great torment awaits you in the grave. 

488
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,660
 I burn into this state. 

489
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,460
 My childrens ... 

490
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,500
 ... you killed my Batur. 

491
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,480
 Did you believe that? 

492
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,860
 Alisar to ... 

493
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,200
 ... Sofia I ... 

494
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,260
 ... as you believe in Balgay. 

495
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,340
 Ah Dündar Bey ah. 

496
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,580
 Abdurrahman Gazi ... 

497
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,460
 ...Kill me. 

498
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,160
 Kill me. 

499
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360
 Or... 

500
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,240
 ...I... 

501
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,180
 ...I will kill all of you. 

502
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,320
 My son Batur's blood ... 

503
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,200
 ... I will not put it on the floor. 

504
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,180
 Kill me. 

505
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,980
 Who sent you to the place where my Osman set up a trap for Balgay? 

506
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,035
 Say, well. 

507
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,480
 Say, our Osman will unleash the mischief established to all of us. 

508
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,620
 Then you will get the answer to the questions you asked. 

509
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,800
 The head of the fitna is Osman. 

510
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,020
 Osman. 

511
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,620
 It is the order of our Osman. 

512
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:01,805
 For his son to do his last duty ... 

513
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,740
 ... secretly tomorrow afternoon ... 

514
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,480
 ... we'll take it to the cemetery. 

515
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,660
 I'll stop at the beginning. 

516
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,880
 I hope they will recover tomorrow. 

517
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,000
 God willing. 

518
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,960
 Go. 

519
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,540
 Go smell of blood as the stepless chick sees you go. 

520
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,760
 It is the smell of the blood you pour. 

521
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,640
 Come to your mind. 

522
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,520
 Enough. 

523
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,720
 Your injustices were enough. 

524
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,700
 Look. 

525
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,480
 What does your daughter say? 

526
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,520
 He says it was enough. 

527
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,080
 It was not enough. 

528
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,120
 Previously Bala is now Day. 

529
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,080
 Those that are not a coincidence. 

530
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,440
 Talk. 

531
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,280
 You have added your mind to your bread. 

532
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,500
 Take it, let the school and yours be yours. 

533
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,560
 Not that... 

534
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,420
 ... my Batur ... 

535
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,380
 ... I will not take the revenge of my Dundar with you. 

536
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,200
 What will you do, Zöhre? 

537
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,080
 Will you ask for help from Mongolian? 

538
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,280
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

539
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,100
 When you say be ... 

540
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,440
 ... our hearts ... 

541
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,780
 ... filled with the light of faith ... 

542
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,480
 ... by ninety-nine names of Allah Almighty ... 

543
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,340
 My valiant comrades ... 

544
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,960
 ... my grandmasters ... 

545
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,160
 ... submissive to the Mongol rule ... 

546
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,960
 ... my principal is Dundar's principality ... 

547
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,060
 ... is over. 

548
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,680
 Sentence world 

549
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,280
 ... he saw seven heifers ... 

550
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,500
 ... Kayılar's future ... 

551
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,860
 ... but not the servants who took orders or money from Mongolian ... 

552
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,220
 ... who don't favor any world ... 

553
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,800
 ... the coach will determine the valiant. 

554
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,560
 Because of that... 

555
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,400
 ... Kayı obasi principality ... 

556
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,560
 ... until my father returns ... 

557
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,660
 ... One of the Kayi gentlemen will act as proxy. 

558
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,520
 I wish... 

559
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,180
 .... to this blessed toy assembly ... 

560
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,520
 ... servant to the people ... 

561
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,100
 ...and... 

562
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,840
 ... let's pick a gentleman who will be his executioner. 

563
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,520
 Mr. Osman... 

564
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,580
 ... what you do is not in style. 

565
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,440
 You forgive our lives. 

566
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,560
 Thank you. 

567
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,600
 Not that... 

568
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,100
 ... because you forgive our lives ... 

569
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,060
 ... we cannot be against the procedure. 

570
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,820
 Şahin Bey is right. 

571
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,540
 Candidates must decide in advance. 

572
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,760
 Candidates must be certain before. 

573
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,460
 Gentlemen ... 

574
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,000
 ... gentlemen ... 

575
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,740
 ... this ceremony ... 

576
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,640
 ... look at those who try to keep this method. 

577
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,600
 Mr. Demirci ... 

578
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,400
 Şahin Bey ... 

579
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,920
 ... with a pouch put in front of it ... 

580
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,660
 ... submissive to the Mongol rule ... 

581
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,720
 ... cannot question the procedure of the toy assembly. 

582
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,120
 We tell the ceremony, not the method, Bamsı Bey. 

583
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,560
 What our intention is bad ... 

584
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,320
 ... nor our words exceed their purpose. 

585
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,820
 Do not exclude Osman Bey's mercy. 

586
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,680
 The procedure is correct, and the sentence is correct. 

587
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,860
 The choice will be made. 

588
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,180
 Bey will be elected. 

589
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,920
 It will be allegiance. 

590
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,960
 Mr. Şahin ... 

591
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:12,875
 ... Demirci Bey ... 

592
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,020
 ... there is no rush. 

593
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,580
 In the toy with my brother ... 

594
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,560
 ... no ceremony. 

595
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,280
 Not that... 

596
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,620
 ... you should know ... 

597
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,300
 ... who was ceremonious ... 

598
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,000
 ... in this oba, he has no business. 

599
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,040
 My father had done it all right. 

600
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,640
 Osman could not stop without sticking a rod. 

601
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,600
 My brother is gone. My father is gone. 

602
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,680
 Is it now in my mother? 

603
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,480
 You too... 

604
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,660
 ... the day was born to patch Osman. 

605
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,720
 Spend both my mother and me. 

606
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,140
 May the square be up to you. 

607
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,980
 Well, you. 

608
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,820
 As the heart of man gets blacker ... 

609
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,120
 his anger becomes brutal. 

610
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,200
 His style gets pretty hot Aygül Hatun. 

611
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,560
 I wish you could hear your ears coming out of your mouth. 

612
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,260
 Oh ah. 

613
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,600
 Now... 

614
00:58:34,195 --> 00:58:36,595
 ... I will talk shortly, Zöhre Hatun. 

615
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,920
 Batur's funeral will be lifted. 

616
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,260
 Like her mother ... 

617
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,760
 ... at the beginning of his son ... 

618
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,120
 ... if you wish to fulfill your last duty ... 

619
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,220
 ... I'll get you out of here. 

620
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,920
 And will you come or not? 

621
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,200
 What do you mean will you come or not? 

622
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,460
 What do you mean? 

623
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,880
 Sure I'll come. 

624
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,440
 Good then. 

625
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,420
 I know it's the fire place of the heart. 

626
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,900
 I understand. 

627
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,760
 Not that... 

628
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,680
 ... if you wish to go to Batur's funeral ... 

629
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,860
 ... you must speak. 

630
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,180
 You have to do with these events. 

631
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,475
 We got it. We know. 

632
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:42,725
 We would like to know beyond. 

633
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,220
 Say, well. 

634
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,240
 Then let's go to our funeral. 

635
00:59:47,775 --> 00:59:48,775
 HE. 

636
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:50,645
 Narrative. 

637
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:53,895
 Come on, Zöhre. 

638
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,640
 Get out of this burden. 

639
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,040
 Be with your son. 

640
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,800
 Tell me. 

641
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,840
 I wanted to protect it. 

642
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,080
 my puppy ... 

643
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,160
 ... my brain ... 

644
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,200
 ... to protect my car. 

645
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,260
 Say, well. 

646
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,100
 I went to Balgay. 

647
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,420
 Mother... 

648
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,620
 What did you do? 

649
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,155
 I asked. 

650
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,320
 Your mother said Aygül. 

651
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,200
 You heard too. 

652
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,600
 This is enough for me. 

653
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,100
 You tell the rest to your daughter. 

654
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,500
 Bud... 

655
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,600
 What is Bala Hatun worrying about? 

656
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,140
 Say, well. 

657
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,915
 Osman says that another chick should look ... 

658
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,340
 ... is it trouble? 

659
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,140
 When Mongolian attacked ... 

660
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,240
 ... from the wound he received. 

661
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,140
 Informally, he will not have children. 

662
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,540
 Since ... 

663
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:23,805
 ... to point the ceremony and choose a gentleman ... 

664
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:24,980
 ...at that time... 

665
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,620
 everybody pour the stone in his saddle. 

666
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,520
 Informal Kayı obasi ... 

667
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,040
 ... as before ... 

668
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,280
 ... is not a handful. 

669
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,640
 Our herds too ... 

670
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,820
 ... our crops are also many. 

671
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,620
 We trade both ... 

672
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,860
 ... will hold the ceremony at the same time ... 

673
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,640
 ... you need a sharp gentleman. 

674
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,260
 My candidate ... 

675
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,780
 He is Gündüz. 

676
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:08,865
 The word is sweet, the way is nice ... 

677
01:03:09,275 --> 01:03:11,565
 ... decisions are appropriate. 

678
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,660
 My candidate ... 

679
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,340
 ... is Gündüz Bey. 

680
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,600
 We have surpassed all these stables with his determination. 

681
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,780
 We came out of many tough clans with his acumen. 

682
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,780
 I like Gündüz Bey very much. 

683
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,580
 I respect very much. 

684
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,575
 But the sentence light the Kayı oba ... 

685
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,735
 ... I see Osman too. 

686
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,560
 My candidate is Osman Bey. 

687
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,780
 I join Şahin Bey and Demirci Bey. 

688
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,860
 My candidate is Gündüz Bey. 

689
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,700
 I Uthman ... 

690
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,420
 .... Osman is a flood. 

691
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:37,835
 My day is earth. 

692
01:04:39,535 --> 01:04:41,195
 My Osman is water. 

693
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,980
 My day is bread. 

694
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,840
 I Uthman ... 

695
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:49,565
 ... it is fire. 

696
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:53,205
 My daytime is cool. 

697
01:04:56,195 --> 01:04:57,355
 Not that... 

698
01:04:58,155 --> 01:05:00,015
 ... that is the man ... 

699
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,020
 ... see beyond. 

700
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,260
 That is Mr. ... 

701
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,960
 ... cut off both sides of your pusat. 

702
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:12,515
 The extract ... 

703
01:05:18,955 --> 01:05:20,435
 my vote ... 

704
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:23,165
 UmAdIr Usman. 

705
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,325
 He is in Osman Bey. 

706
01:05:36,235 --> 01:05:38,245
 My Bamsı Bey talks right. 

707
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,900
 My candidate is Osman Bey. 

708
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,880
 We stopped. 

709
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,420
 He ran. 

710
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:56,855
 We looked. 

711
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:00,365
 He shot. 

712
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,780
 The occupation has come. 

713
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,940
 We all bowed. 

714
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,440
 He raised his head. 

715
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:17,135
 It was our hope, our freedom, our honor. 

716
01:06:17,605 --> 01:06:19,075
 He's not a brother to me ... 

717
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,345
 ... the world is the hereafter, comrade. 

718
01:06:25,175 --> 01:06:28,365
 I, my father Ertuğrul Gazi ore ... 

719
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,920
 ... not in the solution ... 

720
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,300
 ... I'll see him. 

721
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,060
 I know and believe that ... 

722
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,700
 ... Kayı's good fortune ... 

723
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:44,595
 ... is Usman. 

724
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,960
 Say my vote ... 

725
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,360
 ... is for Osman. 

726
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,700
 Duties ... 

727
01:07:15,595 --> 01:07:16,885
 ... happy birthday ... 

728
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,160
 ... both are tough. 

729
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,300
 My brother ... 

730
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,960
 ... careful ... 

731
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,180
 ... also careful. 

732
01:07:30,575 --> 01:07:32,415
 In this difficult process ... 

733
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,380
 ... cool blood in Kayılar ... 

734
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,160
 ... can see beyond ... 

735
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,280
 ... who firmly held the ceremony ... 

736
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:44,345
 ... a fair gentleman is required. 

737
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,320
 My brother Gündüz Bey ... 

738
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,400
 ... white hair in white milk ... 

739
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:58,140
 ... has the discretion to distinguish the black snake on the black stone. 

740
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,520
 My candidate ... 

741
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:12,485
 .... my brother is Gündüz Bey. 

742
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,620
 I waive all my votes. 

743
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,680
 Ertuğrul Gazi's deputy ... 

744
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:29,605
 ... my brother is Gündüz. 

745
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,800
 Happy principality, brother. 

746
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,600
 Happy principality, brother. 

747
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,260
 Thank you brother. 

748
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,800
 I am Gündüz Bey, bring your principality to Kayılar. 

749
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,640
 Thank you Samsa Bey. 

750
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,240
 If you wish, I wish to reach obama. 

751
01:11:30,595 --> 01:11:33,585
 It is necessary to pull it up and pack it up. 

752
01:11:33,715 --> 01:11:35,615
 Excuse me, Samsa. 

753
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,235
 Happy birthday, Mr. Gündüz. 

754
01:11:58,345 --> 01:11:59,345
 Thank you. 

755
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:08,785
 Happy birthday, Mr. Gündüz. 

756
01:12:10,615 --> 01:12:11,615
 Thank you. 

757
01:12:25,795 --> 01:12:27,105
 Happy birthday, son. 

758
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,385
 Thank you Bamsı Bey. 

759
01:13:23,535 --> 01:13:24,535
 Batur. 

760
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,460
 The day he joined the first gas ... 

761
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,640
 his courage would be executioner. 

762
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,540
 Our path was different. 

763
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,380
 But Allah is witness ... 

764
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,020
 ... his intention was not bad. 

765
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,880
 If her father hadn't stopped after ... 

766
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:54,555
 ... would not end like this. 

767
01:13:59,665 --> 01:14:02,495
 The heads of those who made you this ... 

768
01:14:02,665 --> 01:14:04,565
 ... I will take it with my own hands. 

769
01:14:05,635 --> 01:14:06,635
 May it be Ant. 

770
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:11,095
 Son, we will take revenge. 

771
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,020
 Who will we buy from? 

772
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,100
 Who makes this shit? 

773
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,040
 I don't know who founded this game for now. 

774
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,680
 But those who set these traps ... 

775
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,280
 ... he thinks he has reached his goal for now. 

776
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,280
 From this job ... 

777
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,800
 ... they wanted you to be held responsible. 

778
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,780
 They also got what they wanted. 

779
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,300
 I will wash the traps they set up on their heads. 

780
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,580
 If they can't fight like sooner ... 

781
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,480
 ... then I will speak the language they understand. 

782
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,280
 Because of this ... 

783
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,920
 ... you hide Dundar's life, son? 

784
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:49,615
 Those who installed these games ... 

785
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,200
 ... let's say we won. 

786
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,960
 Let the ranks become more frequent. 

787
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,880
 Even this misty air where the devil wears a muslim mintan ... 

788
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,600
 I will distribute it with a wolf claw. 

789
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,880
 Until that day ... 

790
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,080
 ... I should have killed Batur. 

791
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,020
 When the time comes ... 

792
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,660
 ... to disassemble those demons ... 

793
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,040
 I'm going to tear off their heads. 

794
01:15:17,355 --> 01:15:18,525
 What about Dundar? 

795
01:15:21,235 --> 01:15:22,235
 Mr. Dundar ... 

796
01:15:24,325 --> 01:15:26,245
 ... while his son was buried 

797
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,640
 Bamsı Bey is the right to be at the head of his grave. 

798
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,400
 I notified. 

799
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:35,785
 Abdurrahman Gazi will bring him to the place before his funeral. 

800
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,400
 Thank you Osman. Thank you. 

801
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:46,880
 Guys I ... 

802
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,740
 Balgay fled. 

803
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,680
 The only direction Balgay will escape from now is time to death. 

804
01:15:53,535 --> 01:15:55,535
 Can't get rid of my paw. 

805
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,155
 You wrecked. 

806
01:16:18,255 --> 01:16:19,485
 You consumed yourself. 

807
01:16:20,945 --> 01:16:22,245
 Not informal. 

808
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:26,195
 Silence as he speaks ... 

809
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,585
 ... pushing closer ... 

810
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,320
 ... to break your heart even every time ... 

811
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,260
 ... my heart won't stand Gonca. 

812
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,140
 It doesn't work like that. 

813
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:51,435
 Not like that, Bala. 

814
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:53,885
 If you don't say ... 

815
01:16:54,665 --> 01:16:56,205
 ... I will say to Osman Bey. 

816
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,000
 You won't say anything. 

817
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,820
 We're going to pack up here. 

818
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,620
 It would be better if we were not here. 

819
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 No, mother. 

820
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,100
 Tell me why your face is confused. 

821
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,480
 I'll tell you, son. 

822
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,620
 Is it about Bala? 

823
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,380
 Tell me, master. 

824
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,300
 Bala is in big trouble, son. 

825
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,880
 It is tested with the hardest test for a chick. 

826
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,440
 What is that test? 

827
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:39,925
 Tell me. 

828
01:17:40,665 --> 01:17:43,335
 Say, master, don't put it in curiosity. 

829
01:17:46,915 --> 01:17:49,305
 The wound he received when Mongolian attacked ... 

830
01:17:52,525 --> 01:17:55,685
 ... the darkness that comes between you is that wound, son. 

831
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,580
 Not that he doesn't love you. 

832
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:10,260
 Apart from the fear of not being able to give you a son, the chick said to look. 

833
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,820
 Who says that? 

834
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,020
 What is certain? 

835
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,360
 No I for this reason ... 

836
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,020
 .... would I leave it, mother? 

837
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,120
 I know, son. 

838
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:36,660
 I know. 

839
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,040
 Your love is as bent as your heart. 

840
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,060
 She said that the chick looking at Bala. 

841
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,740
 After the wound he received, he said that hope cannot be stopped from Allah. 

842
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,260
 Of course, he does not lose hope in Allah. 

843
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,100
 However, the inside of the floor will be heated. 

844
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,480
 Who knows what he thought? 

845
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,440
 What did he do? 

846
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,680
 I wish I would have gone on more. 

847
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,220
 If I had learned before. 

848
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,740
 It was roasted with its own troubles for a while. 

849
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,080
 But now the trouble is both of you. 

850
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,720
 You reveal so much for each other than to love each other. 

851
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,800
 I know, you can overcome this, evelallah. 

852
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,800
 You matured me again. 

853
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,640
 You sprinkled water in my heart. 

854
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,420
 You learned the real thing to me ... 

855
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,640
 ... May God not make you missing me. 

856
01:19:50,395 --> 01:19:51,745
 It shouldn't be missing. 

857
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:16,340
 Walk! 

858
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,840
 Where are you taking me? 

859
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,920
 Why is there no one? 

860
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,760
 They went to see Balgay's account. 

861
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,260
 How? 

862
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,360
 How did they dare to do this? 

863
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,500
 You did not know Osman Bey. 

864
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,220
 Everything happened with you thanks to Yannez Sofia. 

865
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,680
 Walk! 

866
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,500
 Traitor Salvador. 

867
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,340
 Salvador. 

868
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,480
 You're free now, Princess. 

869
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,840
 Helen Andreas where are they? 

870
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,680
 As we escaped from the cage they blocked us ... 

871
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:23,040
 Andreas is dead. 

872
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,140
 Helen is waiting for us. 

873
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,340
 Salvador... 

874
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:34,675
 ... I will never forget this. 

875
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,800
 You found the trouble ... 

876
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,080
 ...Dervish. 

877
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,100
 Let's take Helen and return to the castle immediately. 

878
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,500
 Who are you? 

879
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,240
 Grim's. 

880
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,420
 I have seen many womans wishing to be my soul. 

881
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,560
 All under the ground. 

882
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,900
 Abdurrahman Gazi. 

883
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,080
 Alps. 

884
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,680
 Allahu akbar! 

885
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
 Sword! 

886
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,540
 Sword. 

887
01:23:40,445 --> 01:23:41,655
 Erkut. 

888
01:23:50,755 --> 01:23:51,755
 Are you okay? 

889
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,420
 Abdurrahman Gazi ... 

890
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:55,160
 Sword. 

891
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,140
 Erkut. 

892
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,840
 Eşhedü en la ... 

893
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:02,420
 ... by God, 

894
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,420
 Alişar. 

895
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,680
 Alişar ... 

896
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,360
 ... you? 

897
01:24:26,445 --> 01:24:27,445
 Alişar ... 

898
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,020
 .... you? 

899
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,060
 To leave Dündar Bey in the hands of the jackals like you ... 

900
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,640
 ... does the banner like me suit the brain? 

901
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,600
 To hide behind his dogs and bark ... 

902
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,620
 ... come if you happen. 

903
01:24:45,075 --> 01:24:46,305
 Come Alişar. 

904
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,140
 Abdurrahman Gazi. 

905
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,540
 You have a heart like this mountain. 

906
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,020
 ... thank you, everything will work out, son. 

907
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,860
 Welcome girl. 

908
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,900
 I found it nice, Selcan Hatun. 

909
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,180
 I was going to put in sherbet. 

910
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:12,000
 Let's get ready together. 

911
01:26:26,455 --> 01:26:28,905
 Like no other than you in my heart ... 

912
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,300
 ... I have no intention of looking for anyone else, Bala. 

913
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,340
 You are my prayer. 

914
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,320
 Be you ... 

915
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,340
 ... son is the discretion of Allah. 

916
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,300
 While we love each other so much ... 

917
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:01,460
 ... is the power of a dagger wound enough to separate us, Bala? 

918
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,320
 Osman... 

919
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:09,180
 ... not. 

920
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,740
 No way. 

921
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,780
 You will have your sons. 

922
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,500
 I will not benefit you. 

923
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,160
 Are you naughty to me? 

924
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:21,380
 Bala ... 

925
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,960
 ... without you will distract me. 

926
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,700
 Being without you is the biggest obstacle between me and tomorrow. 

927
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,060
 You tell me ... 

928
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,960
 ... the force. 

929
01:27:36,635 --> 01:27:37,735
 You force. 

930
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,180
 You are the light of my way. 

931
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:42,980
 Joyful... 

932
01:27:45,155 --> 01:27:46,475
 ....You are my dream. 

933
01:27:47,035 --> 01:27:48,595
 You sevdamin. 

934
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,360
 My Sheikh also ... 

935
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,740
 ... taking his consent ... 

936
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
 ... it is my biggest dream to build a home with you. 

937
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:08,565
 You're my black lover, babe. 

938
01:28:12,595 --> 01:28:13,595
 May Allah ... 

939
01:28:15,065 --> 01:28:16,475
 ... if she doesn't give up ... 

940
01:28:18,745 --> 01:28:20,055
 I am willing to ... 

941
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:24,840
 I am willing to everything after I was with you. 

942
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:28,980
 Well ... 

943
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,460
 are you willing to 

944
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,860
 Be you ... 

945
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,980
 ... I am willing to everything, Osman. 

946
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,500
 Is there any destim, sir? 

947
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,600
 Come on, Boran. 

948
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,500
 With permission. 

949
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:10,340
 There is a brave man who wants to see you. 

950
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,660
 buyursun. 

951
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,920
 Where is the range Osman Bey? 

952
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,800
 It is to the Red Apple. 

953
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,880
 White beards will wait for you, Osman Bey. 

954
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,920
 Your duty is important. 

955
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,340
 We failed, sir. 

956
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:23,860
 Forgive. 

957
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,860
 You are here ... 

958
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,800
 ... this is what matters to me. 

959
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,160
 You negotiated with Osman for me, sir. 

960
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,880
 You shouldn't have done this. 

961
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,660
 I can turn all this tip into blood sea for you. 

962
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,160
 Where's Andreas? 

963
01:31:08,025 --> 01:31:09,025
 Him-her-it... 

964
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:11,340
 ... they killed him, sir. 

965
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,560
 Is it foolishness you do ... 

966
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,080
 ... or betrayal? 

967
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:24,400
 It doesn't matter. The cost is death in both. 

968
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,760
 Master Yannez ... 

969
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:30,320
 It is Salvador who saved our lives by killing Edebali's dervishes. 

970
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,460
 The princess says it right. 

971
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,740
 Thanks to Salvador, our lives were saved. 

972
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:39,080
 Moreover, he was injured while fighting with us. 

973
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,840
 Go to your room, boy. 

974
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
 For the reward I will give you ... 

975
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,960
 ... expect news from me. 

976
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,960
 Salvador is lying. 

977
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:30,160
 But sir. 

978
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,820
 The rats in the church ... 

979
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,335
 ... every day a cat ... 

980
01:32:33,335 --> 01:32:36,395
 ... tired of disturbing themselves ... 

981
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,720
 ... make a decision. 

982
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:41,220
 They will wear a ring around the cat's neck ... 

983
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,960
 ... and when that future ... 

984
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,340
 ... they will be informed beforehand. 

985
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,960
 Thus ... 

986
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:50,020
 ... they will live peacefully. 

987
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,380
 But... 

988
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,960
 ... hearty enough to wear this bell ... 

989
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,860
 they need an idiot mouse. 

990
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,260
 Here Osman ... 

991
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,100
 ... that fool has found the mouse. 

992
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,800
 Are you going to kill Salvador, sir? 

993
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,360
 No. 

994
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,080
 I will kill the cat. 

995
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:18,900
 Until then, I'm going to use this brave, but so stupid mouse. 

996
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,360
 How are you going to do this, sir? 

997
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,740
 Salvador ... 

998
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,100
 ... Kuluca Hisar Castle ... 

999
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,720
 ... I will appoint the commander. 

1000
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,780
 Balgay is now angry. 

1001
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,220
 But when you have time ... 

1002
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,200
 ... will come over us. 

1003
01:34:00,175 --> 01:34:01,315
 The Obama ... 

1004
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:03,780
 ... it is necessary to increase the measures. 

1005
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,100
 Thank God the trust of the people ... 

1006
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,940
 They are fulfilled. 

1007
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,440
 Informal now ... 

1008
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,300
 ... even if Balgay comes ... 

1009
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,640
 ... knows the strength he will encounter. 

1010
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,580
 For all its melanet ... 

1011
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:21,080
 ... It was good that Osman did not mince to Dündar Bey. Bamsı Bey. 

1012
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,560
 Because it would take time to establish the union you said. 

1013
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,880
 You're right, you are right. 

1014
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:30,160
 Is there a destructor Gündüz Bey? 

1015
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,000
 Come on, brother. 

1016
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,400
 Come on, brother. 

1017
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:55,160
 Brother... 

1018
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,020
 ... we need to find Balgay. 

1019
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,540
 He lost everything. 

1020
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:03,420
 It will likely escape to Konya. 

1021
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:05,180
 If we don't prevent ... 

1022
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,260
 will come stronger. 

1023
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,420
 What should he do? What is on his mind, Osman? 

1024
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,980
 If you let me ... 

1025
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,100
 ... I would like to take Konur and Boran with me and be on the road. 

1026
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,100
 I will hunt down Balgay without going to Konya. 

1027
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:25,700
 Son ... 

1028
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,280
 ... if you can't catch it on the road ... 

1029
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,980
 ... if he arrives in Konya. 

1030
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:34,180
 As soon as I don't listen to Ecel bird on a mountain slope, I'm Bamsı. 

1031
01:35:35,335 --> 01:35:37,555
 Then I will take your life in Konya. 

1032
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,220
 Thank you. 

1033
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,840
 Have an ear in the castle. 

1034
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,700
 Sıddık is still in office. 

1035
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,260
 They expect news from us. 

1036
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:50,080
 When the time comes ... 

1037
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,895
 ... to Kuluca Hisar Castle ... 

1038
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,580
 ... We will erect the banner of Kayı with the permission of Allah. 

1039
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:56,260
 Hey, thank you. 

1040
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,280
 I did not let the eyes be left behind. 

1041
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,960
 Have a nice trip. 

1042
01:36:03,415 --> 01:36:04,415
 Thank you. 

1043
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,000
 Thank you, Bamsı Bey. 

1044
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:11,520
 Abdurrahman Gazi will bring Dundar Bey before the funeral. 

1045
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,880
 Before being exiled ... 

1046
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,940
 ... let her son do the last job with her chick. 

1047
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,880
 Brother, no one should know that Dündar Bey lives. 

1048
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,320
 Only this is how I can find out who set us up. 

1049
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,280
 With permission. 

1050
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:54,380
 We opened our conquest banners, Sıddık, brother. 

1051
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,180
 Now you should listen to me well. 

1052
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,440
 The lives of Osman Bey are sacrificed for his command. 

1053
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,900
 What should I do Boran Alp? 

1054
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,160
 You'll kidnap Sofia and hand it over to Yannez. 

1055
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,820
 Thus, their trust in you will increase even more. 

1056
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:13,060
 When we rest on the gates of that castle with our conquest banners ... 

1057
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,480
 ... you will be the one who opens the castle to us. 

1058
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:37,700
 Or divine ... 

1059
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:41,600
 ... my duty is heavy. 

1060
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,960
 To Osman Bey ... 

1061
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,340
 ... Osman Bey was also embarrassed to act as an embarrasser to his ummah Muhammad. 

1062
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:50,900
 Or divine ... 

1063
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:55,100
 ... Osman Bey and his companions 

1064
01:38:55,435 --> 01:38:57,805
 ... embarrassed action in front of the tub. 

1065
01:38:59,135 --> 01:39:01,605
 Give them such a victory ... 

1066
01:39:02,155 --> 01:39:04,225
 let the innocents feast. 

1067
01:39:06,815 --> 01:39:08,045
 If you wish ... 

1068
01:39:08,815 --> 01:39:10,245
 ... that feast day ... 

1069
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,795
 ... this Sıddık servant be the victim. 

1070
01:39:15,305 --> 01:39:17,065
 For the glory of Islam ... 

1071
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,020
 ... I am willing to deliver the soul. 

1072
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:23,120
 As long as.. 

1073
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,640
 sacrifice for these believers, dear. 

1074
01:39:30,015 --> 01:39:31,575
 You made me mourn. 

1075
01:39:32,285 --> 01:39:33,385
 Finally ... 

1076
01:39:34,395 --> 01:39:36,695
 Keremen is a martyr. 

1077
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,360
 Amine. 

1078
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,280
 Salvador... 

1079
01:39:57,860 --> 01:39:59,340
 Sir, Yannez is waiting for you. 

1080
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,120
 I am coming. 

1081
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:09,040
 Thousands of horsemen will come from behind. 

1082
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,440
 Wait. 

1083
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,400
 Osman Bey will come. 

1084
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,100
 Overbearing... 

1085
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,020
 Come on, sir. 

1086
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,920
 ... take over the duties of the soldiers. 

1087
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,540
 Gather my men loyal to me. 

1088
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,300
 Let them come to the mansion tonight. 

1089
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,340
 Mr. Alişar Bey, starboard ... 

1090
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,340
 ... you are giving a great feast. 

1091
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,000
 You're welcome, sir. 

1092
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:01,680
 Malik ... 

1093
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,320
 ... tell the oba. Upon the order of Geyhatu ... 

1094
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:10,660
 ... to find out that I am the starboard again. 

1095
01:41:11,025 --> 01:41:12,825
 If anyone does ... 

1096
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:22,240
 Show Geyhatu's edict. 

1097
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,920
 What if they resist? 

1098
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,200
 Smash them worse than Balgay. 

1099
01:41:34,975 --> 01:41:37,525
 Let them know that I even ate Balgay's head ... 

1100
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,720
 ... behave like that. 

1101
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,420
 As for Kayılar ... 

1102
01:41:46,955 --> 01:41:49,805
 I will visit them personally. 

1103
01:41:51,695 --> 01:41:53,205
 This is yours, sir. 

1104
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,620
 You stealing my gold, Kuyuca Hisar ... 

1105
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:13,800
 .... You brought Kayırlar to the brink of war ... 

1106
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:17,740
 ... did you take care of the land that I entrusted you? 

1107
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,080
 Overbearing... 

1108
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:21,920
 Come on, sir. 

1109
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,220
 ... get my clothes ready. 

1110
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,560
 We are done with Balgay for now. 

1111
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:32,580
 Now I have an account with the so-called Sofia. 

1112
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,540
 Did you place Dündar Bey in his room? 

1113
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:36,920
 I placed it, sir. 

1114
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,460
 I'm so glad. 

1115
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,860
 I told so. 

1116
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,740
 Your love ... 

1117
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:55,560
 ... was not in love to fade away. 

1118
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,140
 I have not asked for myself until today. 

1119
01:42:59,135 --> 01:43:00,625
 If it is ... 

1120
01:43:01,445 --> 01:43:03,595
 ... if we are going to establish a home with Osman ... 

1121
01:43:04,405 --> 01:43:07,565
 ... my only unofficial prayer would be to give him a son, Gonca. 

1122
01:43:07,615 --> 01:43:09,025
 Hopefully Balaam. 

1123
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:10,375
 God willing. 

1124
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:12,500
 It will be with the permission of Allah. 

1125
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,560
 God willing. 

1126
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,540
 Is there a destruction? 

1127
01:43:18,855 --> 01:43:20,475
 Here, Osman Bey. 

1128
01:43:36,865 --> 01:43:38,865
 I was going to Selcan Hatun. 

1129
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,460
 Excuse me. 

1130
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:00,700
 I saw that smile ... 

1131
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,440
 ... is not a scale if the road goes to the end of the world. 

1132
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:09,880
 What way Osman? 

1133
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:11,940
 What's up? 

1134
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,660
 Balgay does not come to leave his dog alone. 

1135
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,520
 If I do not go after him, he will get stronger and come back. 

1136
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:22,000
 May Mongolian not be a big problem for us. 

1137
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,680
 If I don't take Balgay's life ... 

1138
01:44:23,975 --> 01:44:25,855
 ... the issue will get bigger. 

1139
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:29,455
 If I catch it on the road, it wasn't on the road, Konya did not ... 

1140
01:44:29,665 --> 01:44:31,655
 ... I will surely breathe. 

1141
01:44:33,655 --> 01:44:35,205
 Until I returned ... 

1142
01:44:36,155 --> 01:44:38,145
 ... don't leave the camp unless necessary. 

1143
01:44:38,425 --> 01:44:39,825
 Whatever you say. 

1144
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:41,825
 Don't worry about us. 

1145
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,540
 Be very careful for God's sake. 

1146
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
 Or... 

1147
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,160
 Are you afraid that something will happen to me? 

1148
01:44:52,615 --> 01:44:54,255
 Nothing to you. 

1149
01:44:55,075 --> 01:44:58,515
 May Allah take your tiredness, pain and pain ... 

1150
01:44:58,835 --> 01:44:59,855
 ... give it to me. 

1151
01:44:59,855 --> 01:45:01,395
 No. 

1152
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:03,435
 I wouldn't call it a prayer amen. 

1153
01:45:06,155 --> 01:45:07,345
 Be good. 

1154
01:45:10,035 --> 01:45:11,635
 The rest comes to me. 

1155
01:45:16,515 --> 01:45:19,505
 I don't know how, but when you laugh ... 

1156
01:45:20,295 --> 01:45:21,975
 ... my power is multiplied. 

1157
01:45:23,045 --> 01:45:26,245
 As if they said you could knock over the mountains. 

1158
01:45:28,905 --> 01:45:29,905
 Let's. 

1159
01:45:31,195 --> 01:45:34,295
 You should not miss your love or prayer. 

1160
01:45:36,255 --> 01:45:39,185
 My prayer and love are with you. 

1161
01:45:39,505 --> 01:45:41,405
 May you be entrusted to Allah. 

1162
01:46:13,195 --> 01:46:14,385
 Mr. Dundar ... 

1163
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:15,960
 ...are you okay? 

1164
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:21,080
 I will host you in my mansion in a dignity. 

1165
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:22,780
 You don't worry. 

1166
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,320
 Me here ... 

1167
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,220
 ... why did you bring me here, Alişar? 

1168
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:29,075
 Just me... 

1169
01:46:29,505 --> 01:46:32,165
 ... I must go to the thesis obama. 

1170
01:46:32,405 --> 01:46:33,405
 Why? 

1171
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:36,780
 Osman to finish his unfinished job? 

1172
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:43,920
 With Osman Samsa's horsemen, he printed the oba and ... 

1173
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:47,120
 ... put Gündüz on his father's post. 

1174
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,100
 What do you say? 

1175
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:51,820
 He will play his brother on his finger until the time comes. 

1176
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:53,900
 That ... 

1177
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,860
 ... until the oba becomes the lord. 

1178
01:46:58,395 --> 01:47:00,955
 I am the power of attorney, Alişar Bey. 

1179
01:47:01,115 --> 01:47:02,505
 He can't do that. 

1180
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:05,520
 He told everyone you're dead. 

1181
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,160
 In reporting to Geyhatu ... 

1182
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,460
 ...her... 

1183
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:14,600
 ... damn the day I saved your life. 

1184
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,160
 If I quit, Balgay took his life. 

1185
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:20,480
 Dündar Bey Dündar Bey commitment. 

1186
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:25,280
 This was Osman's intention from the beginning. 

1187
01:47:26,845 --> 01:47:27,845
 At that time... 

1188
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,420
 why didn't he kill me. 

1189
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:38,660
 Who knows what mischief is in his head. 

1190
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,320
 Now we arrive ... 

1191
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:44,720
 ... I will take Zöhre Hatun and Aygül from the caged tent. 

1192
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:48,180
 You are at rest. 

1193
01:47:49,805 --> 01:47:50,805
 Zöhre. 

1194
01:47:53,905 --> 01:47:54,905
 My daughter. 

1195
01:47:55,615 --> 01:47:56,615
 My daughter. 

1196
01:47:57,085 --> 01:47:58,085
 Leave. 

1197
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,020
 Everybody know you are dead. 

1198
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:07,300
 If they find out that they are alive, we cannot even know what to do with Zöhre Hatun and Aygül. 

1199
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,020
 Is not it? 

1200
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,760
 My daughter. 

1201
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,260
 My daughter. 

1202
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,540
 Catalonia's ... 

1203
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:26,545
 ... his blind warrior, Salvador. 

1204
01:49:27,135 --> 01:49:29,725
 The justice of our holy father ... 

1205
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:33,020
 with the mercy of our holy mother, 

1206
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,500
 ... ruled. 

1207
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:39,000
 You... 

1208
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:41,600
 ... Kuluca Hisar Castle ... 

1209
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,220
 I declare the commander. 

1210
01:49:51,405 --> 01:49:52,405
 Father... 

1211
01:49:53,195 --> 01:49:54,195
 ...son... 

1212
01:49:54,705 --> 01:49:57,495
 ... and in the name of his holy spirit. 

1213
01:50:01,295 --> 01:50:03,785
 If I leave the path of our holy father ... 

1214
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:07,600
 ... let this sword be separated from my meat and bone. 

1215
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:23,120
 Alişar Bey has arrived. Princess is waiting for you. 

1216
01:50:26,185 --> 01:50:27,885
 Tell Master Yannez. 

1217
01:50:34,675 --> 01:50:35,675
 Amen. 

1218
01:50:41,945 --> 01:50:43,765
 Stay true to our holy father ... 

1219
01:50:44,235 --> 01:50:47,475
 ... that I will fight our enemies to my last breath ... 

1220
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:49,880
 ... that I will live my life for honor ... 

1221
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,920
 ... I swear. 

1222
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,660
 Mr. Alişar came, sir. 

1223
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,180
 I have one question for you. 

1224
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:42,740
 Answer my question correctly. 

1225
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:47,520
 What did Osman offer to your father to sell Balgay? 

1226
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,980
 I'm sure it's not your miserable life. 

1227
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,240
 You know everything. 

1228
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:57,740
 I am sure... 

1229
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:00,780
 ... you know the answer in this. 

1230
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:10,260
 Genghis Khan laws ... 

1231
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,980
 ... and the dagger. 

1232
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:22,700
 What about you... 

1233
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,500
 ... how dare you come here? 

1234
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,320
 Geyhatu this letter ... 

1235
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:37,580
 ... ordered me to give you as starboard. 

1236
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,580
 He wants laws and daggers. 

1237
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,180
 In return for what? 

1238
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,780
 Osman's death ... 

1239
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,680
 ... and for your life. 

1240
01:54:16,535 --> 01:54:19,745
 Osman overwhelmed Balgay alone. 

1241
01:54:21,335 --> 01:54:24,115
 You know you will come again for revenge. 

1242
01:54:26,335 --> 01:54:27,695
 Geyhatu to ... 

1243
01:54:29,655 --> 01:54:30,655
 ...you... 

1244
01:54:32,015 --> 01:54:33,435
 How will I trust? 

1245
01:54:44,595 --> 01:54:46,405
 Your scent is killing me, chick. 

1246
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:50,340
 Not that... 

1247
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,800
 how to smell when he died 

1248
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,740
 you can't even guess. 

1249
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:09,160
 I know the lockers you turned behind me. 

1250
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:14,260
 If you are with me ... 

1251
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:17,355
 I'm ready to forget them all. 

1252
01:55:19,855 --> 01:55:21,375
 He kills Osman ... 

1253
01:55:22,135 --> 01:55:25,105
 ... if I give the laws and the dagger to Geyhatu ... 

1254
01:55:27,615 --> 01:55:29,455
 ... we both win. 

1255
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:43,135
 Osman killed Dündar. 

1256
01:55:45,255 --> 01:55:47,695
 He conquered him with his brother. 

1257
01:55:49,825 --> 01:55:50,955
 Now... 

1258
01:55:52,335 --> 01:55:53,365
 ...tell me... 

1259
01:55:56,475 --> 01:55:58,635
 ... what do you have? 

1260
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:03,320
 Dundar lives. 

1261
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:07,660
 With his cheeky wife and beautiful daughter ... 

1262
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:10,220
 ... the only branch he can keep alive ... 

1263
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:12,000
 ...just me. 

1264
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:16,860
 I will give her obey to Dündar. 

1265
01:56:16,865 --> 01:56:18,855
 ... we will do it with you. 

1266
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:27,060
 How will I trust Geyhatu? 

1267
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:29,520
 Geyhatu married Princess Adelfa and ... 

1268
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:33,560
 ... wants to strengthen trade relations with Byzantium. 

1269
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:36,960
 Princess set out for Konya. 

1270
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:41,060
 Sofia is now one enemy for both of us. 

1271
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,100
 Osman. 

1272
01:56:49,475 --> 01:56:50,965
 You are with me ... 

1273
01:56:52,345 --> 01:56:53,795
 ... or black soil ... 

1274
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,120
 ...Princess. 

1275
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,240
 Solve now, Selcan Hatun. 

1276
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,880
 It is my right to go to my brother's funeral. 

1277
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,780
 If the matter was right law ... 

1278
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:28,620
 ... My Batur did not deserve black land, Aygul. 

1279
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:40,080
 Good listening, Zöhre. 

1280
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,035
 After these things ... 

1281
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,360
 ... this bite does not bite you. 

1282
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:47,880
 Meat your son's funeral. 

1283
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:50,340
 Then take your daughter and go to this place. 

1284
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:53,980
 Take shelter in Mongolian you wish. 

1285
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,880
 What does that mean? 

1286
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,560
 The judgment of treachery is death in Oghuz ceremony. 

1287
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:08,360
 Pray for the mercy of Gündüz Bey. 

1288
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,160
 It does not take care of itself that needs us to enemies. 

1289
01:58:16,855 --> 01:58:18,745
 It is easy to say traitor. 

1290
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:21,100
 Enough! 

1291
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,735
 Shameless, stupid, immoral dog! 

1292
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:28,740
 Whatever happened was from your ambition. 

1293
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,260
 You scribbled unless you could shoot Osman. 

1294
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,040
 It wasn't enough, you came to Balgay, you knelt. 

1295
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:37,655
 You lost your son again, you don't mind. Enough! 

1296
01:58:37,655 --> 01:58:39,715
 Selcan Hatun. 

1297
01:58:41,535 --> 01:58:42,995
 Let me solve me now. 

1298
01:59:03,505 --> 01:59:06,235
 Go and have your last job on your son. 

1299
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:08,780
 If you have a face to look at, still look. 

1300
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:10,200
 Say goodbye to your son. 

1301
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,720
 Come on. 

1302
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:25,200
 You did not waste your trust in you, Osman Bey. 

1303
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:28,340
 You sprayed Balgay. 

1304
02:00:28,515 --> 02:00:31,905
 The campaign is from us, victory is from Allah. 

1305
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:34,015
 Thank god. 

1306
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:37,380
 Turks will not surrender to anyone ... 

1307
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,300
 ... saw in Balgay. 

1308
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:41,780
 Not that... 

1309
02:00:42,445 --> 02:00:45,355
 ... informal is more difficult than that. 

1310
02:00:45,365 --> 02:00:46,365
 You know. 

1311
02:00:48,325 --> 02:00:49,885
 If I don't destroy Balgay ... 

1312
02:00:50,795 --> 02:00:53,085
 ... will return with much greater power. 

1313
02:00:53,905 --> 02:00:56,585
 Our issue is bigger. 

1314
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:01,020
 Our informal struggle will be more difficult. 

1315
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,800
 Now... 

1316
02:01:03,575 --> 02:01:06,175
 ... you should listen to me, son. 

1317
02:01:09,545 --> 02:01:11,755
 While we make our move ... 

1318
02:01:12,215 --> 02:01:15,185
 ... the devil's army is attacking endlessly. 

1319
02:01:16,895 --> 02:01:17,895
 The Geyhatu ... 

1320
02:01:18,195 --> 02:01:21,305
 ... has made Alişar the sanjak again. 

1321
02:01:21,325 --> 02:01:24,625
 Because it is cold with Balgay. 

1322
02:01:25,285 --> 02:01:28,205
 Because of Genghis Khan's laws, Balgay ... 

1323
02:01:28,205 --> 02:01:30,840
 ... fell out of Geyhatu's eyes. 

1324
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:34,260
 He came back with his anger ... 

1325
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:37,800
 It is clear that he will haunt the Turkish oba 

1326
02:01:38,515 --> 02:01:40,565
 We have finished the courage of Balgay. 

1327
02:01:41,385 --> 02:01:43,855
 There is no power to fear anymore. 

1328
02:01:44,945 --> 02:01:47,185
 We fight tooth to tooth. 

1329
02:01:47,555 --> 02:01:49,455
 We will continue to do so. 

1330
02:01:49,955 --> 02:01:50,955
 Thank you. 

1331
02:01:51,965 --> 02:01:53,245
 There is no doubt about it. 

1332
02:01:54,195 --> 02:01:55,195
 Now... 

1333
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,940
 ... with Balgay ... 

1334
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,000
 ... we have a more substantial job. 

1335
02:02:01,615 --> 02:02:04,885
 Princess living in Constantinople ... 

1336
02:02:04,885 --> 02:02:08,220
 ... by Adelfa emperor ... 

1337
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:12,420
 ... will be married to Mongolian governor Geyhatu. 

1338
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:15,900
 This... 

1339
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:19,980
 ... means the Mongolian Byzantine alliance. 

1340
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:23,020
 An alliance for them ... 

1341
02:02:23,025 --> 02:02:25,555
 ... doom for Turks. 

1342
02:02:28,445 --> 02:02:29,445
 At that time... 

1343
02:02:30,025 --> 02:02:33,125
 ... warrior plains will be caught between two fires. 

1344
02:02:33,915 --> 02:02:34,915
 Mr. Osman... 

1345
02:02:35,935 --> 02:02:37,385
 ... you have to ... 

1346
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:40,425
 ... this is to prevent the scout. 

1347
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:45,240
 Princess Adelfa does not settle for this marriage. 

1348
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,500
 Not that... 

1349
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:52,740
 ... is to take the princess away from the spies of Geyhatu. 

1350
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,860
 Is their route clear? 

1351
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:02,780
 Via Nikia ... 

1352
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:04,860
 ... probably to the old fortress ... 

1353
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,620
 ... they will go to Konya from there. 

1354
02:03:08,745 --> 02:03:11,995
 You have to finish this job at the cost of your soul. 

1355
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:13,760
 I will do my best. 

1356
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:18,600
 I will demolish the traps set up by us by Byzantine and Mongolian. 

1357
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:19,860
 Thank you.

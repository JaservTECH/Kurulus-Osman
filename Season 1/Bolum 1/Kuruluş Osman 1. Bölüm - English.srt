1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:20,860
 (Generic music.) 

2
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,720
 Let's start, boy. 

3
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:43,455
 Let the name of God. 

4
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,740
 Hayy is Allah. 

5
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
 God is Truth. 

6
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
 Hayy is Allah. 

7
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,220
 God is Truth. 

8
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,260
 Hayy is Allah. 

9
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,920
 God is Truth. 

10
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,100
 Hayy is Allah. 

11
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
 God is Truth. 

12
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,520
 Hayy is Allah. 

13
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,540
 My lion, stop it, let it stop. 

14
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,440
 Ohh! 

15
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,300
 Iron ... Beaten in iron pan. 

16
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,080
 Kid is beaten in the iron pan. 

17
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
 Bamsı Bey is the wedding gift of my Aybars. 

18
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,860
 This pusat will end until tomorrow night. 

19
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,880
 No promises I made to him were a lie. 

20
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,540
 Hey gone years hey! 

21
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,795
 Both Osman and Aybars have grown up, brothers ... 

22
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,300
 they became blood brothers. 

23
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,440
 With my father Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

24
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,420
 ... we walk in the companionship you burned, Bamsı Bey. 

25
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,640
 Hey, thank god, thank god I saw these days too. 

26
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,900
 I hope my bravery. 

27
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,220
 Oh dear! 

28
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,920
 So ... what about my Osman? 

29
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,060
 Will our Ertuğrul Gazi return from Konya? 

30
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,320
 Will the sultan and even gentlemen accept his offer? 

31
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,800
 We burned the fire of this furnace with Atamat Alparslan in Malazgirt, Bamsı Bey. 

32
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,940
 We rested in the batter's bosom. 

33
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,300
 In order to call these lands homeland ... 

34
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,240
 ... we fight without tears. 

35
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,120
 Now... 

36
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,380
 ... it's time to take a plane tree into action. 

37
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,840
 Under the sycamore, many shady chested alps ... 

38
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,780
 ... majestic chicks will ignite the fire of a new state. 

39
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,520
 Sentence enemies ... 

40
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,580
 ... sentence sold ... 

41
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,760
 ... we will do ashes with this fire. 

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,960
 Whatever the news will come from Konya. 

43
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,340
 We will never drop my father's happy birthday. 

44
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,080
 May my supreme Lord be my witness. 

45
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,700
 Me and my children ... 

46
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,300
 ... to spread this blessed banner to seven worlds ... 

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,680
 ... we will fight yites. 

48
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
 Hey Mashalah! 

49
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,460
 Hey, thank God! 

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
 Ahanda these ears heard these words ... 

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,080
 ... my eyes don't go open. 

52
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,500
 Obviously, Ertuğrul Bey's stove has already been harmed. 

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,060
 The stove of our already grown Ertuğrul Bey! 

54
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 Ah! 

55
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,060
 Ah! 

56
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,720
 My father, Süleyman Şah, also had this boil. 

57
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,100
 Ertuğrul Bey's trust is on my shoulders ... 

58
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,340
 ... that the provinces issued ... 

59
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,440
 ... look at the mortar, babe. 

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,960
 Dust blows from the wind. 

61
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,000
 You are Dundar Bey. 

62
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,720
 I hope you can overcome all kinds of badries. 

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,500
 Everyone looks ... 

64
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,040
 My brother sees Ertuğrul Bey. 

65
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,440
 Twenty-five years ago, the seeds he planted ... 

66
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,420
 now we collect it as a crop. 

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,960
 ... this agreement welfare to the region ... 

68
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,100
 ... and the chick who will bring peace. 

69
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,040
 Do not underestimate yourself, Dundar Bey. 

70
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,000
 The road is not with the passenger ... 

71
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,880
 ... walked with the comrade. 

72
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,540
 What would happen if you came back like Gündoğdu and Sungurtekin? 

73
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,880
 You gave shoulder ... 

74
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,300
 ... Ertuğrul Bey founded the order. 

75
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,800
 Biceps are available to everyone. 

76
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,465
 But both biceps and trick ... 

77
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,400
 ... you have one. 

78
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,500
 Both ... 

79
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,340
 ... peace lesson ... 

80
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,360
 ... afraid of tranquility, the evil eyes have already removed the snakes from their holes. 

81
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,620
 It is necessary to be cautious. 

82
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,620
 May Allah be my witness ... 

83
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,540
 ... those snakes in the fires ... 

84
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
 ... I burn it alive. 

85
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,740
 Yakarım. 

86
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 I... 

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,540
 I promised my brother Ertuğrul Bey. 

88
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,940
 I will handle this job. 

89
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,900
 Lets. 

90
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,880
 Let's not let Tekfur Yorgopolos wait. 

91
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,020
 Before I arrive at the castle, I wish you to receive your prayer. 

92
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,700
 Oyy! Oyy! Boy! 

93
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,220
 Your father's prayer is always with you. 

94
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,280
 Son. 

95
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,440
 However, there is not much trust in this scale. 

96
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,260
 You open your eyes, son? 

97
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,060
 Don't worry, dad. 

98
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,180
 I am the son of Kaysı's veteran alpine head, Bamsı Bey. 

99
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,920
 The enemy I encounter knows that it will be wasted. 

100
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,740
 Thank you son, thank you! 

101
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,720
 Not that... 

102
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,600
 ... you know too ... 

103
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,060
 ... bravery is not armor to rottenness. 

104
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,820
 You need to be vigilant. 

105
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,320
 It is necessary to sense the arrival of Namerdin. 

106
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,900
 Who is the father of Sezer Namerdin? 

107
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,640
 Mr. Sezer Son. 

108
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,460
 Beyce namili stout. 

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,140
 Oğuz is the advice of the ancestor. 

110
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,380
 Whatever happens to Oğuz comes asleep, he says. 

111
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,440
 The stout son who does not sleep, son. 

112
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,220
 Some sleep while standing. 

113
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,980
 But even while asleep ... 

114
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,920
 ... the standing man, this is the son who senses the coming of prayer. 

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,880
 I think you miss Ertuğrul Gazi, father. 

116
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,420
 Vote! I'm Ertuğrul Bey. 

117
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,320
 No son ... He misses not seeing. 

118
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
 He longs for him. 

119
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
 Son. 

120
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,820
 I see my Ertuğrul Bey in Osman. 

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,140
 Every state of it, every stance ... 

122
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,720
 ... he has every look, son. 

123
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,420
 The son of a person such brave ... 

124
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,420
 ... seeing or not seeing. 

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,160
 My son is my wish that you may be the one who sees. 

126
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,340
 Look, son, this is not your father. 

127
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,000
 ... is the will of the ancestor. 

128
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,940
 Just as if I stood by Ertuğrul Bey ... 

129
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,080
 You stand behind Osman, too. 

130
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,320
 Ayşe Hatun. 

131
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,720
 This ancestor came from the land, Mel ... 

132
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,580
 ... if we take it from Turkmen carpets? 

133
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,520
 I knew that Mr. Gündüz would want them too. 

134
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,600
 I prepared it last night. 

135
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,700
 Thank you chick. 

136
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
 Thank you. 

137
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:03,945
 It is obvious that you drank water from Haymana's spring. 

138
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,265
 Come on, let's. 

139
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,965
 Oh dear. 

140
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
 Hullo. 

141
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,880
 I'm Fred. 

142
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,820
 I aybars. 

143
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,720
 Can't you go? 

144
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,240
 We have henna in the evening and there will be more preparations. 

145
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,920
 Wish you stayed in Oba. 

146
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
 You know... 

147
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,140
 ... duty comes first to the alpine part. 

148
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,180
 It is not Burçin that would leave Osman Bey alone. 

149
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,780
 Pray for us, let's go to the thesis and return with goodness. 

150
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,740
 God willing. 

151
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,880
 May Allah make your way clear, Aybars. 

152
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,400
 There is little left. 

153
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,280
 In the evening, these cotton hands will be hennaed by our wedding. 

154
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,380
 If you see the henna entar that Aygül has planted on me. 

155
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,100
 It's so beautiful. 

156
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,180
 If you see yourself through my eyes. 

157
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,220
 You are so beautiful. 

158
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
 They wait for you. 

159
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
 My Burçin, be entrusted to Allah. 

160
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,060
 You are also Aybars. 

161
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 You too. 

162
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,300
 Hey gidi Kayi's alps. 

163
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,340
 You are like pusat wrapped in silk. 

164
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,780
 Outside nobility, drink fire. 

165
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,460
 Hullo! Hullo! 

166
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,940
 Thank you sir. 

167
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,720
 What are these, son? 

168
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,260
 Tekfura is the pusat that will go as a gift, my father. 

169
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
 Osman. 

170
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,565
 If you said pusat in this place, you come to mind. 

171
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:45,795
 Let's see. 

172
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,880
 Our friend Tekfur Yorgopolos ... 

173
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,920
 ... are you satisfied with these gifts? 

174
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,320
 The pusats that we grasp the hilt and rest on the castle ... 

175
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,400
 ... we take it as a gift to your feet. 

176
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,660
 Why not be satisfied, Mr. Dundar? 

177
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,480
 Mr. Dundar. 

178
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,060
 I'm Dundar Bey. 

179
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,700
 Kayı's informal hand is for us. 

180
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,580
 Just in case. 

181
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,860
 I say I'll come with you, how about you? 

182
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
 We have one hand ... 

183
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,560
 ... stay in the camp, Bamsı Bey. 

184
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,140
 You stay here, finish preparations. 

185
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
 Keep an eye on Oba. 

186
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,320
 Thank you Dündar Bey. 

187
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
 Non... 

188
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,120
 ... let's be on your way. 

189
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,120
 Be entrusted to Allah, I hope to go to the thesis and return to the thesis 

190
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,880
 Tekfur Yorgopolos, the trade agreement in peace, was exactly what we wanted. 

191
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,820
 However, compensation to be paid for caravan raids cannot be accepted. 

192
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,960
 Don't worry, Calosnose. 

193
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,535
 No power can seal me that substance. 

194
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,800
 I have no doubt about it. 

195
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,620
 Although ... 

196
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,220
 ... even though the seeds of this agreement were planted with Ertuğrul ... 

197
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,340
 his brother Dundar 

198
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,860
 ... wants to be the one to finish the job. 

199
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,260
 Sure, he wants to show everyone his strength with this deal. 

200
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,800
 We will always be strong, with the permission of God. 

201
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,020
 It... 

202
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,180
 ... a talisman that will protect my beloved husband. 

203
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,385
 As long as you are with me ... 

204
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,700
 ... nothing can hurt me. 

205
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,015
 I'm a very lucky man. 

206
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,320
 Let us still be cautious. 

207
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,480
 Last night's stars darkened me or maybe ... 

208
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,120
 ... maybe you will say empty faith, but ... 

209
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,840
 ... I was uneasy. 

210
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,940
 Don't worry about me, Sofia. 

211
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,780
 Commander Kalonoz, the greatest warrior of Bitinyan ... 

212
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,980
 ... it protects me. 

213
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,620
 Kayi are coming, sir. 

214
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,900
 Tekfur nibs. 

215
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,035
 Welcome, Dundar Bey. 

216
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,320
 We welcome, Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

217
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,980
 Princess Sofia. 

218
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,320
 Valiant women of Kayı, you are welcome too. 

219
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,020
 You honored our pen. 

220
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,320
 That honor belongs to us, princess. 

221
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,520
 I wish Ertuğrul Bey was also here in this beautiful day. 

222
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,380
 We owe this joy more than anything else. 

223
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,580
 Our game is starting! 

224
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,180
 Ertugrul! 

225
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,800
 Tekfur if you want me, here it is! 

226
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,160
 Here I am. 

227
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,580
 What have you scared of me so far ... 

228
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,700
 nor me. 

229
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,840
 Let's finish this job. 

230
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:13,120
 (Sword sounds) 

231
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,060
 That 's enough! This war is over! 

232
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,440
 I want to be relying on us. 

233
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,720
 My belly is full ... 

234
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,520
 ... have a good back. 

235
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,220
 Bless you! 

236
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,920
 Bless you! 

237
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,000
 Bless you! 

238
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,520
 Bless you! 

239
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,280
 We said war until the last drop of our blood ... 

240
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,020
 ... now we will call peace. 

241
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,440
 Bless you! 

242
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,480
 So with my brother Dündar ... 

243
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,160
 ... let's reinforce the promise between us. 

244
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,860
 We celebrate this deal with a nice feast when I return. 

245
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,120
 Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

246
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,460
 You are an honored man. 

247
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,840
 Your mind is as sharp as your sword. 

248
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,020
 As for Ertuğrul Bey ... 

249
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,460
 As for Ertuğrul Bey ... 

250
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,640
 All Bitinya knows his bravery. 

251
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,100
 If he sees hungry, he will fill. 

252
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,300
 Equips if he sees naked. 

253
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,540
 It saves the debtor from his debt. 

254
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,020
 Muslim ... 

255
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,460
 ... non-Muslims are indispensable. 

256
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,480
 The friendship of Ertuğrul Gazi and his children, yaman ... 

257
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,200
 ... his enmity is great. 

258
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,120
 Protect Tekfur. 

259
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,180
 Alps warlord scheme. 

260
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,680
 This is betrayal, betrayal! 

261
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,220
 Your slave, your soldiers. 

262
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,580
 How would you allow such a betrayal? 

263
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,520
 Whose dog are you? 

264
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,540
 Who are you? 

265
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,900
 I said talk, let's talk. 

266
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,820
 (Sword sounds.) 

267
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,380
 Finish your job. 

268
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,080
 Fitne is the brother of the castle. 

269
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,380
 Is everyone okay? 

270
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,020
 Thanks to everyone, Osman. 

271
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,540
 Thank god. 

272
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,460
 If we don't learn who is behind these jackals ... 

273
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,520
 ... let us all know forbidden sleep. 

274
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,940
 Even if it's not today ... 

275
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,780
 ... sooner or later they will find their target arrow. 

276
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,500
 At this challenging tip called Bitinya ... 

277
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,540
 ... how much time is it ... 

278
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,140
 ... do you know how strong I was, Nizamettin Efendi? 

279
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,640
 Always smelling. 

280
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,620
 The good and the bad have a unique smell. 

281
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,680
 Whether it's good ... 

282
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,040
 Whether bad ... 

283
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,320
 You must have a scent. 

284
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
 Now... 

285
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
 ... tell me, what's up? 

286
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,500
 Kayılar went to the castle, Alişar Bey. 

287
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,300
 Obviously they will deal with tekfur. 

288
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,660
 Do you think Tekfur accepts the conditions? 

289
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
 They set off with gifts. 

290
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,360
 The Greeks were also preparing for entertainment. 

291
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,100
 The pen in this land is also mine ... 

292
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,700
 ... the paper to be written is mine. 

293
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,580
 Without me, that deal has no value. 

294
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,880
 This move will break the power of the new market. 

295
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,780
 If an agreement is reached ... 

296
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,940
 ... The value of the willow market will increase. 

297
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,620
 Obviously the balances are getting more sensitive. 

298
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,740
 But there is something they forgot. 

299
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,260
 Which bail I am on ... 

300
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,660
 ... the scale migrates to that side. 

301
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,100
 Zöhre Hatun. 

302
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,000
 This epic shock shook me deeply. 

303
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,000
 No matter how sorry I am ... 

304
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
 ..little. 

305
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,940
 From the state you are in ... 

306
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,860
 ... you cannot go out with embarrassment and embarrassment. 

307
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,000
 Princess. 

308
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,080
 What happened was really shocking. 

309
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,480
 It did not suit the magnificence of Kulacahisar Castle. 

310
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,900
 Your castle is very patchy ... 

311
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
 ... but obviously its doors are weak. 

312
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,460
 If it was not unlocked from the inside ... 

313
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,160
 ... this disaster would not come from outside. 

314
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,240
 Yorgopolos will quickly find traitors who open the door. 

315
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,840
 Thanks to your bravery and warfare ... 

316
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,360
 ... my dear husband is still alive. 

317
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,940
 He hadn't been praising Kayılar for all this time. 

318
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,860
 Whoever in our place would do the same. 

319
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,480
 Peace and friendship require this. 

320
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,080
 Isn't that why we're not here anyway? 

321
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,620
 There are obstacles to peace and friendship. 

322
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,000
 What happened today has shown us this. 

323
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,120
 This attack is not only tekfura ... 

324
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,000
 … melting was also done. 

325
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,380
 As you said, I hope the traitors have time. 

326
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,120
 Or what is behind it, Dundar Bey ... 

327
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,520
 ... nor do I leave it, insha'Allah. 

328
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,920
 Accept my apologies, Mr. Dundar. 

329
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,160
 Why would I accept? 

330
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,480
 Tekfur Yorgopolos, how embarrassed I was ... 

331
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,040
 First of all, to accept your apologies ... 

332
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,980
 ... it is necessary to find out who is meant by our soul. 

333
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,140
 Be sure I'll find out who they are as soon as possible. 

334
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,140
 It is obvious Dundar Bey that we have badly stepped on someone's feet by making the agreement. 

335
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,120
 We were dying for less. 

336
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,695
 With which face ... 

337
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,795
 ... would you say that you will keep the promises of the agreement? 

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,280
 Moreover, we can not agree in some way ... 

339
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,620
 What will be the conditions you postpone? 

340
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,540
 If it will refresh your trust in me ... 

341
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,940
 Dundar Bey, I am ready to accept those conditions. 

342
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,360
 Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

343
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,960
 Are you sure? 

344
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,840
 Making such an important decision all at once ... 

345
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,400
 How accurate do you think? 

346
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,300
 This is the Calosnose that is true. 

347
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,120
 Let this be done today. 

348
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
 Let it end ... 

349
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,640
 ... Kayılar should not doubt our friendship. 

350
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,360
 What about you Gündüz Bey? 

351
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,280
 Today, I say good luck with this work, my dear Mr. Dundar. 

352
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
 When Ertuğrul Bey returned ... 

353
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,560
 We give the feast in our camp. 

354
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,240
 At that time... 

355
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,680
 ... let's finish the deal as soon as possible. 

356
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,300
 Come on, let's go to the table. 

357
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,420
 What about the compensation of merchant caravans? 

358
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,940
 These are very heavy conditions. 

359
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,060
 It... 

360
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,900
 ... Commander Calosnose that applies to both sides. 

361
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,060
 Whoever happens on their land ... 

362
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,320
 he pays compensation. 

363
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,180
 After the caravan raid, bandits cross the border and lose track. 

364
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,780
 Compensation will bend all of us. 

365
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,300
 Unacceptable Gündüz Bey. 

366
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,020
 Of course, the acceptable Commander Calosnose. 

367
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
 Osman. 

368
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,200
 How Osman Bey? 

369
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,920
 The bandits are reckless because they crossed the border and saved their lives. 

370
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,960
 Every word you say is precious to me. 

371
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,160
 Continue your words. 

372
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,400
 If you go beyond the border and authorize me to cut the account ... 

373
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,640
 ... the bandits will understand that they will not have anywhere to escape. 

374
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,920
 Thus, there will be no such thing as compensation. 

375
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,960
 Do you trust this much, Osman Bey? 

376
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,120
 It showed how capable it is today. 

377
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,840
 What do you say about Mr. Dundar? 

378
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,280
 Niece's Osman is not considered unfair. 

379
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,420
 My nephew thought well. 

380
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,080
 But this way ... 

381
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,080
 ... both dangerous ... 

382
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,200
 ... is also power. 

383
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,180
 Tracing ... 

384
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,000
 ... chasing people for days is not everyone's fee. 

385
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,380
 If we give you this duty ... 

386
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,500
 ... can you handle it, Osman Bey? 

387
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,500
 This situation will ignore our limits ... 

388
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,740
 ... unacceptable Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

389
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,340
 This authority is only for the Kayi alps that are attached to me ... 

390
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,200
 ... and if you give it to a commander you serve ... 

391
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,440
 ... Kalonoz also has no questions left in its head. 

392
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,300
 Madun Dündar also gives approval ... 

393
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,780
 ... then for my own limits ... 

394
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,720
 ... I'll give you permission, Osman Bey. 

395
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,580
 I will determine who will be the commander as soon as possible. 

396
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,020
 See this also as a sign of today's bravery. 

397
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,740
 Do not be missing Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

398
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,700
 To follow the bandits crossing the border ... 

399
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:07,360
 Forgive, sir. 

400
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,680
 Excuse me, sir. 

401
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,500
 Sir, forgive. 

402
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,580
 You are incapable of killing an old tekfuru. 

403
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,020
 The assassination plans that I knit by bowknot ... 

404
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
 ... you messed up with your incompetence. 

405
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,660
 Osman would have learned everything if you hadn't killed the assassin. 

406
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,100
 That's when ... 

407
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,300
 ... we couldn't explain anything to our master. 

408
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,180
 Now... 

409
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,700
 ... put your best man after him. 

410
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,820
 He should taste our wrath at the first opportunity. 

411
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,560
 Don't underestimate Osman. 

412
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,780
 He's not a regular person. 

413
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,080
 Surely ... 

414
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,120
 ... Megala should pay for this. 

415
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,020
 Osman what do you think you are doing? 

416
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,880
 What did I have, brother? 

417
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,060
 Osman. 

418
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,360
 We keep pusat sooner ... 

419
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,900
 ... says the word big. 

420
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,000
 What is it to intervene while Emmin is standing? 

421
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,640
 The word is spoken, brother. 

422
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,040
 La havle ... 

423
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,240
 Should I be so thirsty for my soul? 

424
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,100
 And you still raise words in the past. 

425
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,520
 No need to stretch. 

426
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,920
 Enjoy your meal. 

427
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,000
 Orhan you stay here. 

428
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,060
 You're welcome, sir. 

429
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,660
 Aybars come with me. 

430
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,120
 You will be beautiful, henna night Burçin. 

431
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,140
 My Aybars will also like it. 

432
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,380
 Even if you wear tent cloth, he will like it. 

433
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,960
 One day we will have your wedding with Osman, Aygül. 

434
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,120
 You say so? 

435
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,240
 I say that, of course. 

436
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,720
 That's when I sift flour for you too ... 

437
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,540
 ... I will carry water with a griddle. 

438
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,460
 I hope God will give us happiness like yours. 

439
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,740
 God willing. 

440
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
 They will ruin everything. 

441
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,740
 Like his eyes, his hearts are sealed. 

442
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,340
 My brother does not understand with my wife. 

443
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,880
 They have not seen the fitna at the tip of his nose. 

444
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,040
 Who dares, Osman Bey? 

445
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,020
 What does it matter who dares, Aybars? 

446
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,120
 Kayılar's baht is kneaded in the hand of the scorpion. 

447
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,740
 We have always been under threat. 

448
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,360
 Always vigilant ... 

449
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,880
 There will be a great war in this land. 

450
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,960
 I feel it in my marrow, in my bone. 

451
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
 Never forget this war ... 

452
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,640
 ... not those who are vigilant like a pigeon ... 

453
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,320
 ... those who are on the offensive like an eagle or a hawk will win. 

454
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,360
 A state will emerge from our dreams. 

455
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,880
 A state. 

456
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,280
 Heard the Dundar Beys, they say peace. 

457
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,040
 You talk about a state in this turmoil, Osman Bey. 

458
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,980
 Aybars is unofficial to us. 

459
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,640
 The quail hunted the flock and went away. 

460
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
 Non... 

461
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,040
 ... bounty time. 

462
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,580
 Who are these guys, Osman Bey? 

463
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,020
 I am Aybars who did not fit in the castle. 

464
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,140
 Fitna did not fit in the castle. 

465
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,060
 Ya Allah! 

466
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,380
 I'm Ambush Aybars. 

467
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,320
 You are from left flank and I from right flank. 

468
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
 Hayy is Allah! 

469
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,860
 God is Truth! 

470
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,580
 Aybars! 

471
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,000
 Ah! 

472
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
 Aybars! 

473
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,640
 Oh God, are you okay? 

474
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,600
 I'm fine I'm fine. 

475
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,460
 They say that falling blood on henna dress brings bad luck. 

476
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,920
 I'm excited, Burçin. 

477
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,880
 Both have to be good. 

478
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,000
 Think no, no, no, today is your henna day. 

479
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,820
 Aygül still has not returned. 

480
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,440
 Why would you worry about them? 

481
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,940
 Especially, let us prepare you in the best way. 

482
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,380
 Look, Aybars will blow his mind when he sees you. 

483
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,800
 God protect my Aybars. 

484
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,880
 Ah! 

485
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,020
 Seize that Turk. 

486
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,620
 Let's see your jackals. 

487
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,380
 Ha! 

488
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,320
 If I oppose Osman's offer against Tekfur ... 

489
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,220
 ... there is hostility between us, they will think there is duality. 

490
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,540
 This is Osman ... 

491
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,620
 ... whatever it blows on his head. 

492
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,540
 If Osman is blowing, it will fall to you. 

493
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,400
 Otherwise, these empty movements will bring evil to our obese, sir. 

494
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,700
 Is there a destruction? 

495
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,040
 Come to Gündüz. 

496
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
 Emmi. 

497
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,460
 There is no news from Osman or Aybars. 

498
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,480
 They still haven't returned. 

499
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,160
 Don't worry about it, Gündüz. 

500
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,980
 Emmi. 

501
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,820
 I'm not comfortable at all. 

502
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,480
 Is there any news of Bamsı Bey Gündüz? 

503
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,440
 There is no suck. 

504
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,480
 Tell the Alps to set off thesis ... 

505
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,500
 ... scatter them around and not come without finding them. 

506
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,880
 Your order is sure. 

507
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,240
 (The horse is sniffing.) 

508
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,760
 (The horse is sniffing.) 

509
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,620
 He may need help. 

510
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,460
 We don't have much time. 

511
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,640
 Live. 

512
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,420
 We have to remove it. 

513
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,880
 We need to get it out of mud. 

514
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,960
 Check. 

515
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,040
 Come on boy, pull, come on. 

516
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,320
 Come on son. 

517
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,000
 Good for you, pull it. 

518
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,700
 Let's. 

519
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,620
 Come on boy, good boy, pull it out. 

520
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,940
 We lost a lot of time, we have to go. 

521
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,300
 It comes to itself. 

522
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,680
 Help, we have to move. 

523
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,380
 We have to go now, come on. 

524
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,900
 Aybars! 

525
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,100
 Aybars! 

526
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
 Aybars! 

527
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
 Aybars! 

528
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,260
 Aybars! 

529
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,360
 Aybars! 

530
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
 Aybars! 

531
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,720
 Hey, thank you, come here. 

532
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,040
 Come on. 

533
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,815
 Come on. 

534
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,860
 I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to hurt you. 

535
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,100
 Not that... 

536
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,760
 ... sacrifice you in the way of Allah ... 

537
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,240
 I would like to serve the alps in my wedding party of Aybars. 

538
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,740
 Vote! 

539
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,300
 Lets. 

540
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,420
 Bismillah. 

541
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,940
 Vote! 

542
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,780
 Oh dear! 

543
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,980
 I would be grateful to you. 

544
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,720
 May Allah ... 

545
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,880
 ... did not give it to us to sacrifice ... 

546
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,360
 ... would we be nice? 

547
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:16,180
 Ahanda, with our own knife like that. 

548
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,460
 Cut our self honey ... 

549
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,260
 ... sacrifice to Allah ... 

550
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,020
 ... is it easy? 

551
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,740
 It's not easy, of course. 

552
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,320
 It is not easy. 

553
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,840
 Do you know that story? 

554
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,600
 Tell me if you tell me. 

555
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,940
 Well, listen then. Listen. 

556
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,640
 Aybars! 

557
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,560
 My brother. 

558
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,620
 My brother. 

559
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,560
 My dear brother. 

560
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,260
 Before my death ... 

561
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,940
 ... I saw you alive ... 

562
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,520
 Brother, who saves the death from death, brother, effort. 

563
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,180
 Oh, I will take you. 

564
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,040
 Lets. 

565
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,900
 Hang on, brother. 

566
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,320
 Hang on, Aybars. 

567
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,720
 Greetings. 

568
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,220
 The only wish of the prophet İbrahim ... 

569
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,300
 ... to have a son. 

570
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,540
 Of course he asked Allah and ... 

571
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:59,340
 He said, if you give me honey, I will sacrifice my son. 

572
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,940
 Allah is also from our mother Hacer ... 

573
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,560
 ... gave him a honey. 

574
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,880
 The name of the prophet Abraham ... 

575
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,160
 ... Ismail put it. 

576
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,100
 Ismail was brought up. 

577
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,000
 He reached the age of seven. 

578
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,320
 You are so beautiful. 

579
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,740
 Hah like this. 

580
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,720
 Let your little face laugh. 

581
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,960
 Which bride frown like this before henna? 

582
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,820
 Aybars will come, but I will complain to him. 

583
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,740
 My dear brother, I will always say that he was sulking when you were gone 

584
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:00,180
 Sorry Aygül, I upset you today. 

585
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,780
 Do you ever upset me? 

586
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,000
 At that time, the prophet Abraham had a dream. 

587
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,380
 He was told in his dream about the sacrifice of his son. 

588
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,260
 Ibrahim also ... 

589
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,580
 Ismail arrived with him. 

590
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,500
 By her contract ... 

591
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,260
 ... told her dream. 

592
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,300
 Ismail... 

593
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,020
 he looked into his father's eyes. 

594
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,020
 Father, he said. 

595
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,940
 Whatever you do, you should! 

596
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,980
 Vote! Vote! 

597
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,900
 Abraham ... 

598
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,960
 Abraham's heart was crushed. 

599
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,780
 Not that... 

600
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,820
 ...order... 

601
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,800
 He was divine commanded. 

602
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,100
 He is ... 

603
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,260
 He is ... 

604
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,520
 He took Ismail and laid him on his forehead. 

605
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
 Full... 

606
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,200
 He was going to knock his full knife around his neck ... 

607
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,400
 No, no. 

608
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,620
 I hope it is good. 

609
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,680
 Isn't it Osman? 

610
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,520
 We had enough Aybars. 

611
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,700
 We have enough! 

612
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,020
 Notify the thesis healer. 

613
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,660
 Lets. 

614
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,200
 Lets. 

615
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,140
 Call the healer. 

616
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,140
 Hang on, Aybars. 

617
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,780
 (Noise of people.) 

618
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,620
 My friend Garda has come. 

619
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,140
 Aybars! 

620
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,700
 Aybars! 

621
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
 Aybars! 

622
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,800
 My brother, my brother. 

623
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,020
 Aybars! 

624
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,860
 About your ... 

625
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,220
 ... halal. 

626
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,700
 Eşhedü en la la ilaha illallah ... 

627
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,920
 ... and his cousin, Muhammad ... 

628
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,560
 ... abdühü and his Messenger. 

629
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,600
 Aybaaars! 

630
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,780
 Aybars! 

631
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,280
 Aybars! 

632
01:06:32,700 --> 01:07:02,120
 (Crying sounds.) 

633
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,280
 Mr. Osman! 

634
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:15,400
 You couldn't protect Alpini, his blood brother. 

635
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,860
 How do you let it die? 

636
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,660
 How do you let it? 

637
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,320
 Enough. 

638
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,820
 How do you let it? 

639
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,320
 Enough. 

640
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,360
 Enough. 

641
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:32,920
 Enough. 

642
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:52,000
 (Crying sounds.) 

643
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,640
 Osman. 

644
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,140
 Tell you. 

645
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,480
 This work ... 

646
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,340
 ... the original. 

647
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,580
 We ambushed. 

648
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,220
 We hit back with my brother, I'm Bamsı Bey. 

649
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:21,200
 (Crying sounds.) 

650
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,760
 But I couldn't keep my promise to you. 

651
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,460
 I couldn't protect Aybars. 

652
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,780
 (Crying sounds.) 

653
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,380
 Forgive me. 

654
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,780
 Forgive me. 

655
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,940
 Lamb leaving the herd ... 

656
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,060
 ... the wolf snatches. 

657
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,700
 Didn't we remember this to you, Osman? 

658
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,660
 Ha? 

659
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:21,400
 (Crying sounds.) 

660
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,700
 My son Aybars ... 

661
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,160
 ... for the order ... 

662
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,280
 ... next to his blood brother ... 

663
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,240
 ... he drank martyrdom. 

664
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,460
 Is Zinhan ... 

665
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,480
 I have no doubt ... 

666
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,820
 ... blood brother ... 

667
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,200
 ... he did his best for him. 

668
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
 I Usman. 

669
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,480
 You don't worry. 

670
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,800
 I Usman. 

671
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,440
 Hele ... 

672
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,140
 ... you will never shed tears. 

673
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,600
 Hold the upright head. 

674
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,780
 Hold the upright head. 

675
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,080
 You didn't do anything to be ashamed of. 

676
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,300
 Burcin ... 

677
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,680
 ...my daughter... 

678
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,160
 Aybars ... 

679
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,600
 ... your fiancé ... 

680
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,360
 ... the world couldn't meet tomorrow but ... 

681
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,760
 ... has achieved a timeless and eternal tomorrow. 

682
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,120
 My daughter. 

683
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,820
 Burcin. 

684
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,900
 Your... 

685
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,820
 ... your reunion ... 

686
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,160
 ... it is crippled. 

687
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,100
 Veteran alpine head ... 

688
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,100
 Everyone saw it. 

689
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,060
 Just now... 

690
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,140
 ... we erected the wedding tent. 

691
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,920
 Apparently ... 

692
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,320
 My Aybars to fly ... 

693
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,200
 ... went to the mansions. 

694
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,700
 From the palm of Muhammad ... 

695
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,500
 ... went to drink martyrdom. 

696
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:07,680
 Waiting for my son's world wedding ... 

697
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,860
 ... my destiny ... 

698
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,560
 ... martyrdom wedding ... 

699
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,120
 ... to see ... 

700
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,360
 Let the blazed bards lament. 

701
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,240
 Nobody cry. 

702
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,700
 Chimneys hair ... 

703
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,780
 ... cries don't shout. 

704
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,540
 Now. 

705
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,220
 It is a true toy day. 

706
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,440
 It is now the wedding day. 

707
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,600
 Now is the glorious day. 

708
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,160
 Thank God for my tea. 

709
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,760
 I am ... 

710
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,280
 ... I became a martyr's father. 

711
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,320
 I became the martyr's father. 

712
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,140
 Bamsı became the martyr's father. 

713
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,740
 Bamsı became the martyr's father. 

714
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,400
 He is the martyr's father, Bamsı. 

715
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,120
 He is the father of a martyr. 

716
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,240
 We have a wedding, fellows. 

717
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,880
 My son has reached his Lord. 

718
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:35,140
 We have a wedding, fellows. 

719
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,160
 My son has reached his Lord. 

720
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,320
 Sir. 

721
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,180
 Tell me Osman is dead Megala. 

722
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,800
 Sir, free from the swamp he fell. 

723
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,600
 I don't know how. 

724
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,600
 Damn. 

725
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,720
 I hope this incompetence ... 

726
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,620
 ... does not cause other troubles. 

727
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,640
 Break down now. 

728
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,240
 But the closest alpine, Bamsı's son Aybars ... 

729
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:37,820
 ... now everyone in Kayı Oba is crying around his body, sir. 

730
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,000
 We killed him. 

731
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:44,300
 I hope Osman received the message. 

732
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,360
 And he no longer puts his nose in our work. 

733
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,280
 I've been on your way for days. 

734
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,560
 Thank God you finally came. 

735
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,940
 It was a bit troublesome. 

736
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:25,080
 However, it took our tiredness to be elected for such a holy duty. 

737
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,680
 How is our master? 

738
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,160
 Is his health right? 

739
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,340
 They are good. 

740
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,900
 They wonder the status of the castle. 

741
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,245
 You know... 

742
01:18:34,245 --> 01:18:36,660
 He pays special attention to Kulacahisar. 

743
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,780
 God bless her. 

744
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,940
 We heard that things were complicated. 

745
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,160
 You were right in your foresight. 

746
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,780
 To Tekfur Yorgopolos .... 

747
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,020
 an assassination was carried out. 

748
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,180
 I've never seen you be wrong. 

749
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:54,400
 He put him in close contact with the Turks on his target board. 

750
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,780
 Darkness from the demon we are after ... 

751
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,500
 About to cover Kulacahisar. 

752
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,620
 The breath of the devil that is lured by this corridor is their work. 

753
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,240
 Our time is limited. 

754
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,860
 We must immediately fulfill our master's command and find the treasure. 

755
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,560
 If we fail, everything will turn upside down. 

756
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,520
 They sent the password, right? 

757
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,100
 I am proud of you. 

758
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,300
 In the tasks you take on ... 

759
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,320
 ... you never landed our face. 

760
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,020
 It may have been written with a number of secrets from the Bible. 

761
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,160
 It probably refers to various passwords. 

762
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,200
 If we can find clues about secrets ... 

763
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,760
 ... I can solve those numbers. 

764
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,720
 Direction and location information should be hidden by those numbers. 

765
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,700
 You had solved a number of similar secrets of ancient alphabets. 

766
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,195
 Then he finished this job as soon as possible and ... 

767
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,440
 ... we can meet our master with the happiness of the people who have done their duty. 

768
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,300
 I prayed in the church for you, Yorgopolos. 

769
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,780
 God's help and ... 

770
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,920
 ... with the skill of Calosnose ... 

771
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,740
 I'm sure we'll catch those responsible. 

772
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,900
 Alone... 

773
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,260
 Are you sure the traitors are from the castle? 

774
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,000
 We were betrayed, Sofia. 

775
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,520
 And this betrayal is not from outside the castle ... 

776
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,560
 ... came from within us. 

777
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,500
 Yorgopolos if you're right ... 

778
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,200
 ... this is terrible. 

779
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,860
 Empty rotation of the hand. 

780
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,000
 Find a trail that will bring me to them. 

781
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,080
 Otherwise they will try again soon. 

782
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,340
 Yes, sir. 

783
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,820
 My dear husband. 

784
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,880
 I watch the sky every night. 

785
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,960
 I read the traces of stars and planets left by us. 

786
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,360
 There is only one thing I am sure. 

787
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,240
 While you were alive ... 

788
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,680
 ... nobody will wash your order. 

789
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,395
 Your path is not the way, Osman. 

790
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,540
 You know your way, not the way. 

791
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,220
 Without telling anyone ... 

792
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,880
 ... you walked out of the castle. 

793
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,900
 What happened? 

794
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,280
 Ha? 

795
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,860
 Aybars is dead. 

796
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,280
 It happened because of you. 

797
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,420
 Don't you still understand? 

798
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,700
 What do you tame on me? 

799
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,280
 You broke me next to Tekfur. 

800
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,520
 We didn't say anything ... but ... 

801
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,120
 ... how can I keep quiet about this, Osman? 

802
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,980
 Your... 

803
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,140
 ... this is your own command ... 

804
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,060
 They go far above Osman, mother. 

805
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,340
 Did he ever want it to be like this? 

806
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,320
 What will happen? 

807
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,900
 If your father was Ertuğrul Bey ... 

808
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,080
 What would he do? 

809
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,160
 HE? Also to the emmine. 

810
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:04,640
 The issue is unofficial is my question. 

811
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:09,240
 Aybars' blood will not stay on the ground. 

812
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,440
 It is my neck's debt to avenge my grunt. 

813
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,560
 As for my father ... 

814
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,080
 ... If Ertuğrul Gazi, the son of Süleyman Şah, was here ... 

815
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,800
 ... does not accuse me of the death of my blood brother ... 

816
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:28,100
 ... runs after killers with us ... 

817
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,400
 ... made Bitinya hell for them. 

818
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,680
 Now ... 

819
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,300
 Are you going to drag your alps to revenge? 

820
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,520
 Ha? 

821
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,620
 After Aybars ... 

822
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,160
 ... how many more quarries will you shoot, Osman? 

823
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,760
 One mistake ... 

824
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:52,140
 ... if you make one more mistake ... 

825
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:57,920
 ... your punishment will be very heavy, Osman. 

826
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,780
 You should know that. 

827
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,000
 My punishment is my acceptance anyway. 

828
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,660
 If I'm going to bow to two threats that will come out of your lips ... 

829
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,640
 ... it shouldn't get better. 

830
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,860
 Osman. 

831
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,760
 Osman I say to you, Osman! 

832
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,320
 Take this to a tabernacle. 

833
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,040
 Speak with ease. 

834
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,780
 Let's not open another trouble for us. 

835
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,320
 Mother. 

836
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,700
 Talk to my father, master. 

837
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,960
 Don't let Osman get this far. 

838
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,660
 I know Osman. 

839
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:52,600
 He does not rest without putting out the fire that burns his heart. 

840
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,600
 My daughter. 

841
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,940
 You hear with your own ears. 

842
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,380
 Neither her brother listens nor sucks. 

843
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,000
 May God amaze our end. 

844
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:41,200
 (Sela is being read.) 

845
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:57,500
 (Crying sounds.) 

846
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:06,340
 (Sela is being read.) 

847
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,680
 (Crying sounds.) 

848
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:54,920
 (Sela is being read.) 

849
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,060
 Hafza. 

850
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,580
 You should be here ... 

851
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:08,600
 ...three thousand and six hundred... 

852
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:11,720
 ... it's been fifty-five days. 

853
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,420
 That day my Hafza. 

854
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,480
 We are both dead. 

855
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,180
 Not that... 

856
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,800
 ... they buried you alone. 

857
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,600
 A mem ... 

858
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,080
 ... then my lion. 

859
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,900
 My rose face ... 

860
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:44,920
 ... I have seedlings. 

861
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,900
 I lost him to the plague. 

862
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,580
 My lamb has melted before my eyes. 

863
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,620
 These lands ... 

864
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,960
 This is his destiny. 

865
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:02,240
 Toy coaches ... 

866
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,360
 ... the Cenk ... 

867
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,120
 ... coach brave ... 

868
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,600
 the victim goes. 

869
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,280
 Our Aybars who became martyrs. 

870
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,780
 Ahanda ... 

871
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,380
 ... to this land ... 

872
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,960
 ... so that we can call homeland. 

873
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:47,060
 To this land ... 

874
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,480
 ... so that we can call homeland. 

875
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,840
 Oyyyy ... 

876
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:21,420
 It is time for informal revenge brothers. 

877
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,700
 Sparking from their breath ... 

878
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,760
 ... swear at the right horses. 

879
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,780
 May it be Ant. 

880
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,460
 May you swear by those who suffer honey. 

881
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,500
 May it be Ant. 

882
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,620
 I Gardaş ... 

883
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:37,060
 ... if I put my blood, Aybars' blood on the floor ... 

884
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:42,180
 In the black steel core. 

885
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,960
 Let me mow like the sky. 

886
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,620
 Erase my name from bengu stones. 

887
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:48,900
 May it be Ant. 

888
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,000
 May it be Ant. 

889
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,340
 Kulacahisar castle is where the fitna is spread. 

890
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:02,880
 This is where we will seek the trail of those who shed the blood of Aybars. 

891
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,740
 From whom they took orders ... 

892
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,440
 ... we will enter the castle at night to find out what their intentions are. 

893
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,040
 Who will you go to in the castle, sir? 

894
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,340
 Is there someone you trust? 

895
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,420
 There is no one to rely on, except for one person. 

896
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,640
 He is tekfur. 

897
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,300
 Because he was the killer's target. 

898
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,240
 Why will you sneak in, sir? 

899
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,680
 I should meet Tekfur alone. 

900
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:39,360
 Nobody should know. 

901
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,720
 Even the closest ones can be their enemy. 

902
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,040
 What's your order? 

903
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,240
 Now listen to me brothers. 

904
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,860
 Upgrade him, the sun and the moon. 

905
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,160
 Upgrade him all the shining stars. 

906
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,740
 You have dressed the vast waters like clothes. 

907
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,720
 And the waters stood on the mountains. 

908
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,640
 What do these mean? 

909
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,440
 He says he hangs the world on nothingness in the first bab. 

910
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,900
 Sun and moon. 

911
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:38,540
 Shining stars. 

912
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,080
 Sky face. 

913
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,180
 We will look for a sky face inside the castle. 

914
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,000
 It spreads north over the void. 

915
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,660
 Is there a secret room in the northern part of the castle? 

916
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,200
 Sofia's room ... 

917
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,620
 I saw seven planets made of alchemy metals there. 

918
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,220
 In the middle of the magic room ... 

919
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,080
 where stars and planets reflect. 

920
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,020
 Sacred relics are here. 

921
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:18,520
 We are now very close to our secret. 

922
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:54,140
 Sofia. 

923
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,600
 What do you have Sofia? 

924
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,020
 Talk to me. 

925
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,820
 I beg you talk to me, I will do anything for you. 

926
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,460
 I'm suffering a lot. 

927
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,920
 And I can no longer bear this pain. 

928
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,260
 This longing for you hurts me. 

929
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,920
 I want to be with you now. 

930
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,920
 I also want this very much. 

931
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:52,380
 But tekfur ... 

932
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,600
 ... Tekfur Yorgopolos ... 

933
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,500
 ... How do we do this to him? 

934
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,440
 God... 

935
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,920
 ... if God doesn't want us to meet ... 

936
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,140
 Would he drop this love to our hearts? 

937
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,320
 Kalonoz ... 

938
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:16,580
 You are my biggest test in this world. 

939
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,760
 I am every day ... 

940
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:22,975
 ..nightly... 

941
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,160
 I'm suffering with your longing. 

942
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,620
 I die as I see you next to tekfur. 

943
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,200
 But what do we do, Sofia? 

944
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,040
 What do we do? 

945
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,440
 Let me go. 

946
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:49,500
 I will consult the stars tonight, tomorrow night ... 

947
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,120
 I'll send you news. 

948
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,560
 Until today... 

949
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:57,180
 I will wait as I did not expect any news. 

950
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,160
 My God. 

951
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,340
 My Garda Aybars ... 

952
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,660
 and avenge our many martyrs. 

953
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:17,920
 You don't worry. 

954
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,920
 Especially, you should never shed tears. 

955
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,560
 Hold the upright head. 

956
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,780
 Hold the upright head. 

957
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,720
 The Bams ... 

958
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:33,440
 ... became a martyr's father. 

959
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,160
 He became the martyr's father, Bamsı. 

960
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,600
 Why are you so pensive? 

961
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,600
 What do you think? 

962
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:57,940
 No. 

963
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,800
 I was immersed. 

964
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,860
 Come on now, laugh your face. 

965
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,420
 Look, we are very close. 

966
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,900
 You are right. 

967
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,160
 We are very close. 

968
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,320
 We will have completed our duty tomorrow. 

969
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,080
 Is that why your face is sullen? 

970
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,340
 Come on laugh a little bit now. 

971
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,580
 Or... 

972
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,200
 Are you thinking about it? 

973
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,380
 Who? 

974
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,560
 The Turk you saved. 

975
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:40,520
 Who was it? 

976
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,280
 What was he doing there? 

977
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:44,940
 I don't know who. 

978
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,500
 But it is clear that you have in mind. 

979
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,780
 It doesn't come to tell you anything. 

980
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,120
 We need to rest. 

981
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:56,280
 Tomorrow is burdened and on our shoulders. 

982
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,800
 Let's. 

983
01:38:44,500 --> 01:39:45,580
 (Turk is playing.) 

984
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,220
 Alps... 

985
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,720
 If... 

986
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,880
 ... if there are mites in my hair ... 

987
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,860
 Of the angels that bear my Aybars ... 

988
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,380
 ... fell from his wings. 

989
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,600
 He fell from their wings. 

990
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,940
 Mr. Bamsı. 

991
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:48,440
 The scent of the martyr is the scent of heaven. 

992
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:52,940
 Oyyy .... 

993
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,200
 Don't hide our time garbage ... 

994
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,960
 ... it's time to spread its scent to Kayı Oba. 

995
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,180
 Take it. 

996
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,620
 Lets. 

997
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,020
 Come on then valiant. 

998
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,520
 Lets. 

999
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:07,100
 Allahu Akbar! 

1000
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,540
 Allahu Akbar! 

1001
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:09,720
 Allahu Akbar! 

1002
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,660
 Allahu Akbar! 

1003
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:44,640
 (Prayer is being read) 

1004
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,280
 Hello, hello. 

1005
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,040
 Are your goods fresh? 

1006
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,280
 Come on, sir. 

1007
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:41,940
 Deh! 

1008
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,860
 What do you want from me? 

1009
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,840
 Who are you? 

1010
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,740
 Do you know who I am? 

1011
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:00,160
 I am a fortress officer. 

1012
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,740
 You can't do anything to me. 

1013
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,780
 Leave! Leave! 

1014
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:08,380
 Leave! 

1015
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,400
 Leave me! 

1016
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,300
 I have a lot of money, I can give as much as you want. 

1017
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,040
 Don't worry, we'll give you the coin. 

1018
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,880
 (Reading Fatiha.) 

1019
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,420
 We lost my Aybars. 

1020
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,340
 Aybars'ı my ... 

1021
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,120
 ... We lost. 

1022
01:48:01,645 --> 01:48:03,175
 Now ... 

1023
01:48:03,585 --> 01:48:04,795
 ... sırlayıp ... 

1024
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,260
 ... we buried. 

1025
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,440
 Not that... 

1026
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,720
 ... us ... 

1027
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:17,760
 ... the pusat of the unleashed erin ... 

1028
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:21,040
 ... does not stand on the tip of his head. 

1029
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:56,980
 Osman. 

1030
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:05,920
 I Usman. 

1031
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:08,340
 Son. 

1032
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,600
 Non... 

1033
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,500
 ... this pusat is yours. 

1034
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,100
 Can your comrade ... 

1035
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,260
 ... until we get the revenge of Aybars ... 

1036
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:26,380
 ... carry it with you, Osman. 

1037
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,400
 You never worry, Bamsı Bey. 

1038
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:33,100
 The only place where Aybars' murderers will escape ... 

1039
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:34,420
 is where he will die. 

1040
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,820
 My dear comrade ... 

1041
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,080
 ... I swear on the blood pus of my blood brother Aybars ... 

1042
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:56,340
 The death in the emperors of this pusat ... 

1043
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,100
 ... it will be destiny for those who break it. 

1044
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:09,200
 Alps! 

1045
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,680
 Keep in mind here. 

1046
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:16,240
 Every one of you is a loser. 

1047
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,560
 Die down here! 

1048
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,260
 Each of you, you will be the banners! 

1049
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:23,620
 Stroke here! 

1050
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,360
 Each of you ... 

1051
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,700
 ... my son like Aybars ... 

1052
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:34,400
 ... Are you courageous. 

1053
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,240
 You will die. 

1054
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:40,720
 You will die, but ... 

1055
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,420
 ... die here. 

1056
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,440
 You will not die, brave! 

1057
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,180
 (The horse is sniffing.) 

1058
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:29,340
 Master Yannis. 

1059
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,020
 I know everything, Sofia. 

1060
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:39,420
 If your guard wasn't Megala ... 

1061
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:43,380
 He could take one of the assassins and make him speak to me. 

1062
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:55,760
 Ertuğrul's son to me ... 

1063
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,640
 Tell Osman, Sofia. 

1064
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:05,640
 His father rested his dagger on our lungs. 

1065
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:07,560
 But her son ... 

1066
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,140
 ...Osman. 

1067
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,020
 Her eyes look like a predator. 

1068
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,480
 He has already stuck his sinister dagger into our lungs. 

1069
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:27,240
 I'm afraid ... 

1070
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,680
 ... does not seem to leave us carved. 

1071
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,020
 This night... 

1072
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,400
 ... the body of tekfur ... 

1073
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,180
 I want the soul of Calosnose. 

1074
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:47,080
 As for Osman ... 

1075
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,060
 ... his fate ... 

1076
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:52,200
 ... will not be different from his friend. 

1077
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:23,580
 As you commanded, sir. 

1078
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:26,560
 This car will go to the heart of the castle. 

1079
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:28,920
 I will be alone when we enter the castle. 

1080
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,840
 You wait on the door line. 

1081
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:33,920
 If things go wrong ... 

1082
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:36,400
 ... it will be necessary to quit. 

1083
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:38,440
 Come on bismillah. 

1084
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,735
 God help us and get half. 

1085
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,240
 Amine! 

1086
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,960
 Together with Osman, the alps also followed. 

1087
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:59,060
 Boran, Erkut Boğaç ... 

1088
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:01,620
 He likened them to himself. 

1089
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:04,040
 Like a collapsing flood ... 

1090
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:06,000
 ... will drag it one after another. 

1091
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,960
 What's wrong with this crazy boy? Ha? What? 

1092
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:11,180
 Take vengeance on. 

1093
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,300
 Ahh! 

1094
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:15,680
 If my father knew about this situation ... 

1095
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,360
 What will he take with this toy? 

1096
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:24,060
 Obviously he was responsible for what happened to Aybars. 

1097
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,820
 The only thing Osman was right about ... 

1098
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,560
 ... this is the responsibility. 

1099
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,560
 If he thinks so ... 

1100
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:34,300
 ... it is justified. 

1101
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,400
 What happened to Aybars ... 

1102
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:38,880
 He is responsible. 

1103
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,820
 Not that... 

1104
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,440
 ... seeking revenge alone ... 

1105
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,780
 ... what is bloodshed? 

1106
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:47,100
 This oba ... 

1107
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:48,500
 ... this place ... 

1108
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,080
 ... what are we for Day? 

1109
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:53,580
 This is the extreme land. 

1110
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:55,440
 Eat the lamb here with the wolf ... 

1111
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,200
 ... sit ... 

1112
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:59,300
 ... with the herd of the herd ... 

1113
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:00,960
 ... they cry. 

1114
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,840
 Emmi. 

1115
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,220
 Let him return with the permission of Allah ... 

1116
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,380
 ... this time I will teach him such a lesson ... 

1117
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,720
 ... you don't worry. 

1118
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,160
 This is not my job with the lesson, my nephew. 

1119
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:24,940
 The chain that will hold him ... 

1120
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:26,800
 ... is in my brother's hands. 

1121
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:28,620
 About as ... 

1122
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,360
 one listens to him. 

1123
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:32,460
 Will something happen every moment? 

1124
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:35,260
 What will he do this time? living with anxiety ... 

1125
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:37,920
 It knocked my shoulders. 

1126
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:46,120
 Hayırlısıyla ... 

1127
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:49,100
 ... even if my brother returned from Konya ... 

1128
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,940
 ... a little bit too ... 

1129
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,760
 ... if I was comfortable. 

1130
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:04,660
 Stop! 

1131
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:08,640
 Where's Alexis? Who are you? 

1132
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:10,480
 I'm Alexis's cousin. 

1133
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,860
 He needs to rest for a few days. 

1134
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:21,260
 OK late. 

1135
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,360
 Hey coachman! 

1136
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,840
 (He makes a noise with his mouth to stop the horse.) 

1137
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:39,740
 What's in your car? 

1138
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:42,320
 I brought wine for Kale cuisine. 

1139
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,640
 Isn't it our right to drink from these beautiful wines? 

1140
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:47,060
 Your right, of course. 

1141
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:09,240
 Nice, go now. 

1142
02:03:10,325 --> 02:03:11,325
 Koc ... 

1143
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:14,140
 ... takes the moon down from the sky. 

1144
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:18,100
 Stars in the sky attract their spells. 

1145
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,640
 (The doorbell rings) 

1146
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:44,820
 Come. 

1147
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,360
 It's time, Helen. 

1148
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,940
 Now bring the lovers together. 

1149
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:06,060
 Sofia. 

1150
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,460
 What if we fail? 

1151
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:16,360
 Helen doesn't feel pessimistic about the souls devoted to our holy father. 

1152
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:17,640
 Go. 

1153
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:19,780
 Open the door of hope. 

1154
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:31,260
 Be careful. 

1155
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,820
 Bring that keg, too. 

1156
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:56,320
 We took so much trouble, without tasting it. 

1157
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:03,260
 Ah! 

1158
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:16,640
 This is where we are, the cellar. 

1159
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,480
 I will proceed from here. 

1160
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:22,040
 I will enter the room from the balcony of Tekfur from here. 

1161
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:27,060
 Now get to the alps. 

1162
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,340
 Street tops, castle entrances, they keep everywhere. 

1163
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,620
 Thank you sir. 

1164
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,040
 What will this be, sir? 

1165
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:15,360
 Don't worry, Tekfur Yorgopolos. 

1166
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:16,700
 My Osman. 

1167
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:27,680
 Mr. Osman. 

1168
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:31,060
 Your... 

1169
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:34,820
 ... in this disguise, what are you doing here? 

1170
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:38,100
 We are both ... 

1171
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:41,260
 ... we are after the same thing, Yorgopolos. 

1172
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:46,460
 The arrows thrown at you did not reach your target. 

1173
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:47,460
 Not that... 

1174
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:51,080
 ... after I left the castle, my brother reached Aybars. 

1175
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:55,720
 To Bambarian's son Aybars? 

1176
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:59,860
 They martyred him. 

1177
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:08,200
 They wanted to kill me for saving my life in the castle. 

1178
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:13,660
 However, my brother paid for this. 

1179
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,000
 What kind of caliper did we fall into, Osman? 

1180
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:20,360
 Don't call this fitting stove out, Yorgopolos. 

1181
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:22,900
 Apparently... 

1182
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:26,120
 ... surrounded by a circle of betrayal. 

1183
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:34,720
 Do not trust even the closest. 

1184
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:52,160
 How will we reveal these traitors? 

1185
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:53,960
 Who do you trust most in the castle? 

1186
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:57,080
 My wife Sofia, my castle commander 

1187
02:07:57,080 --> 02:07:58,420
 ... his assistant Andreas. 

1188
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:03,740
 Shall we make the alliance with these? 

1189
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:04,480
 No. 

1190
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,660
 We will start with them. 

1191
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:10,140
 They never betray me. 

1192
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:12,140
 Betrayal is not remote ... 

1193
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:14,320
 ... comes the closest. 

1194
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:15,800
 Leave. 

1195
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:19,300
 If they are innocent, let's see them all together. 

1196
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:23,360
 My request from you is ... 

1197
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:25,420
 ... my three most trusted alps ... 

1198
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:28,400
 ... let me put it in your castle in rum. 

1199
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:32,340
 ... let's go over betrayal step by step. 

1200
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,740
 Then ... 

1201
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:36,860
 ... let's get stuck in the heart of betrayal like this arrow. 

1202
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,020
 Informal than that ... 

1203
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:43,200
 ... we are your fate partner with you, Yorgopolos. 

1204
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:53,540
 We got it, Osman Bey. 

1205
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:01,240
 Osman stop. 

1206
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:18,760
 Judging by the sounds, the square became crowded. 

1207
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,280
 It would not be right to get out of the front balcony. 

1208
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:26,520
 Osman. 

1209
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:27,660
 Hide here. 

1210
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:42,900
 Guard, what are the voices outside? 

1211
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:44,300
 Go and see. 

1212
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:50,880
 Bring me wine, too. 

1213
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:02,340
 Osman, come on. 

1214
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,260
 God help us, Osman. 

1215
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:09,620
 Osman. 

1216
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:24,740
 [What is Osman doing in Tekfur's room?] 

1217
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,160
 Come. 

1218
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:16,520
 Tekfur nibs, I have something to tell you. 

1219
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:17,460
 What? 

1220
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:23,760
 Before you say it alone ... 

1221
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:26,060
 I will ask you to forgive me, sir. 

1222
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:28,000
 If you want me to forgive your life ... 

1223
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:30,940
 ... you brought me information that I didn't like. 

1224
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:33,040
 What? 

1225
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:36,440
 Will you forgive me, sir? 

1226
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,680
 Come on say it. 

1227
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:44,500
 I saw something terrible. 

1228
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:45,440
 Your wife ... 

1229
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,880
 ...Princess Sofia... 

1230
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:49,120
 ... cheating on you. 

1231
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:51,520
 Ah! 

1232
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:55,760
 Are you sure? 

1233
02:11:58,140 --> 02:11:59,740
 I saw it with my eyes. 

1234
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:00,900
 Sir. 

1235
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,580
 How do you do 

1236
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:18,120
 How can you do this to me, Sofia? 

1237
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:47,640
 Kalonoz. 

1238
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:49,240
 Sofia, darling. 

1239
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:50,980
 What did the stars say? 

1240
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,200
 He said that we will finally meet. 

1241
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:56,160
 I will never leave you. 

1242
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:59,240
 I'm so happy to be able to touch you. 

1243
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,080
 Sofia! 

1244
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:28,060
 Kalonoz! 

1245
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:29,500
 Tekfur Yorgopolos, listen to me. 

1246
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:32,220
 Damn you both. 

1247
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:37,820
 I loved it, I couldn't speak my heart. 

1248
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:40,720
 Yorgopolos is all my fault, I beg him. 

1249
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:41,840
 Kill me. 

1250
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:46,880
 Damn the day I love you, Sofia. 

1251
02:13:47,540 --> 02:13:48,540
 Die! 

1252
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:18,740
 Died, darling. 

1253
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,820
 Darling, she has died. 

1254
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:58,640
 We got rid of it. 

1255
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:00,380
 Not yet yet. 

1256
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:06,100
 They shouldn't find this body here. 

1257
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,320
 After throwing it ... 

1258
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:19,980
 ... let's go to our rooms and play our game. 

1259
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:44,080
 Hurry, we are going out of Boran Alp. 

1260
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,400
 Did you see Tekfuru, sir? 

1261
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:01,720
 My dear sir. 

1262
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:03,700
 Lets go. 

1263
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:05,820
 If they find out that we are here, the job remains on us. 

1264
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:07,800
 No getting out of here without solving this job. 

1265
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:10,580
 Wait for news from me. 

1266
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,400
 Come on, run! 

1267
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:46,580
 Tekfur is dead! 

1268
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:34,440
 I know you. 

1269
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:43,040
 It was you who saved me from death in the swamp. 

1270
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:10,740
 I had chosen you as an angel. 

1271
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:26,420
 Go away. 

1272
02:19:28,060 --> 02:19:29,560
 And who are you? 

1273
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:33,780
 You want this. 

1274
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,280
 Come and learn then. 

1275
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:53,840
 Let's see then. 

1276
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:58,180
 Who was hidden behind the angel's face?

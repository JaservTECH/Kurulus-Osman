1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:02:03,540
 [Generic] 

2
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:56,325
 Geyhatu for me ... 

3
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,115
 ... what did you say Gündüz? 

4
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,460
 From the smell of Geyhatu ... 

5
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,900
 Balgay didn't know what the language said. 

6
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,120
 Talk! 

7
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,340
 Ah! 

8
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:19,295
 Also from the laws ... 

9
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,300
 ... from your affairs ... 

10
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
 ... I did not know. 

11
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,020
 That ... 

12
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,040
 ... push ... 

13
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,180
 ... until I bring me here and connect me. 

14
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,040
 God! 

15
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,460
 You will tell everything. 

16
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,100
 The meat ... 

17
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,840
 ... until he could not keep his blood unofficial ... 

18
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,580
 ... I know you are full of holes. 

19
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,860
 Munchers are ready, Balgay. 

20
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,940
 Still no news from Tongar? 

21
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,820
 No, Balgay. 

22
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,880
 His hand won't turn empty. 

23
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,800
 Make this speak until I get back from Kocahisar. 

24
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,180
 This is yours, Balgay. 

25
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,760
 Commander Laskaris ... 

26
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,420
 Don't return to the castle without finding Princess Sofia. 

27
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,800
 Did you understand me? 

28
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,160
 I swear on behalf of our Virgin Mary ... 

29
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,740
 ... I will not return without finding the princess, sir. 

30
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,960
 Turks too ... 

31
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,160
 To the day when Mongolians came to our lands ... 

32
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,480
 ...damn it. 

33
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,335
 Master Yannez, Osman Bey came. 

34
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:21,925
 Bring it on. 

35
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,100
 Osman Osman! 

36
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
 Sofia. 

37
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,080
 Where is my daughter? 

38
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,200
 When Selcan came from the mother oba ... 

39
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
 ... to prove that you have it ... 

40
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,300
 ... you showed me your dagger. 

41
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,460
 I'll never forget Yannez. 

42
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,260
 Sofia is in my hand. 

43
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,020
 What did you do to him? 

44
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,340
 Comfortable. 

45
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,880
 He sleeps like a lamb in his cage. 

46
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,720
 He waits for his father to save him. 

47
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,380
 If you do anything to my daughter ... 

48
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,080
 I came here to make a deal. 

49
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,180
 If you leave me alive ... 

50
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,740
 then Sofia survives. 

51
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
 What do you want from me, Osman? 

52
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
 Balgay. 

53
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,460
 Leave! 

54
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,020
 Late! 

55
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,280
 Leave! 

56
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,560
 You can't treat me like that, open my eyes. 

57
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,040
 Open my eyes! 

58
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,860
 Open! 

59
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,800
 Bala Hatun. 

60
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,480
 The circuit is back, Sofia. 

61
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,520
 Andre Salvador and Eleni ... 

62
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,300
 ...where are they? 

63
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
 There's no use in knowing them. 

64
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,780
 I brought more important news. 

65
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,860
 You like it very much. 

66
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,080
 My father... 

67
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,920
 ... Sheikh Edebali ... 

68
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,060
 ... went to compile the valiant, ahis, who were thirsty for the gas. 

69
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,340
 Osman Bey has unimaginable accounts. 

70
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,280
 And the fire burning in front of your eyes ... 

71
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,480
 ... you don't see armies carrying wood on that fire. 

72
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,380
 Pity. 

73
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,880
 This hyena wants a stronger bond. 

74
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,920
 Let's cut the ropes, Zülfikar Derviş. 

75
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,900
 Zülfikar Derviş. 

76
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,160
 Exit Press. 

77
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,340
 Exit Press. 

78
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,660
 It won't be Bala. 

79
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,660
 Whether I die or live, your end is certain. 

80
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,620
 You will disappear. 

81
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,480
 Before I cut my judgment .. 

82
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,380
 ... measure your height, especially. 

83
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,125
 Take it ... 

84
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,905
 ...little girl. 

85
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,380
 You murdered Ahi Evran. 

86
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,420
 Sheikh Edebalı came. 

87
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,535
 Fairly, Wrestler, Zulfikar ... 

88
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,340
 ... Bud, dervishes ... 

89
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,220
 Ahis came, Sofia. 

90
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,640
 Had enough ... 

91
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,840
 Osman Bey came. 

92
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,760
 Today ... 

93
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
 Today ... 

94
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,080
 ...Keep in mind. 

95
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,100
 I don't forget. You forget. 

96
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,915
 Don't remember this state. 

97
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,975
 Are you okay Bala Hatun? 

98
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,195
 If I give Balgay to you .. 

99
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,660
 ... Geyhatu washes the castle on our heads. 

100
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,295
 Sooner or later you know this will happen. 

101
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,820
 I made an agreement with Balgay. 

102
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,240
 Why would I betray him? 

103
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,500
 You both play games with each other. 

104
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,740
 Who do you think will finally win? 

105
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,380
 Are you... 

106
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,140
 ... or Balgay? 

107
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,760
 The two of you will crash into each other's throat at the first opportunity. 

108
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,920
 You too... 

109
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,840
 ... I am the only one who can save my OB from Balgay. 

110
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,240
 And then? 

111
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,580
 The flood goes ... 

112
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,540
 stays on Yannez. 

113
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:21,305
 At that time... 

114
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,140
 ...also with you... 

115
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,700
 ... with your daughter ... 

116
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,500
 ... we will also face the evil forces behind you. 

117
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:32,875
 And you. 

118
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:35,285
 What about us? 

119
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,475
 Tell, I'm listening to you. 

120
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:52,235
 Tomorrow... 

121
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,320
 ... you will persuade Balgay to go to İnegöl tekfur. 

122
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,420
 He will deliver his castle ... 

123
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,480
 ... he will be convinced that he will receive gold and spoils with chests. 

124
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,980
 After leaving Balgay's headquarters ... 

125
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,080
 ... I know which way to go with his soldiers. 

126
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,500
 Are you going to ambush him on İnegöl road? 

127
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,900
 We will both get rid of Balgay. 

128
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:20,875
 With a handful of Alp ... 

129
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,020
 ... do you think he can handle his soldiers? 

130
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,740
 This is my matter. 

131
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,560
 Let's say you killed Balgay. 

132
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,580
 When you're done ... 

133
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,815
 How do I know that you will give my daughter back to me? 

134
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,720
 You will rely on the words of Osman, son of Ertuğrul Gazi. 

135
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,320
 Soldiers. 

136
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,780
 Hostility is another trust. 

137
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,440
 I can trust you. 

138
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,540
 But... 

139
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,560
 ... big cases ... 

140
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,980
 ... does not walk with confidence. 

141
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,360
 As the engagement sign between us ... 

142
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,120
 I will give you the laws of Genghis Khan. 

143
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,000
 When the time comes, take her daughter and ... 

144
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,180
 ..you will give the laws. 

145
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,240
 What if you die? 

146
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,720
 The laws of Genghis Khan ... 

147
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:52,455
 ... is more precious to us than Sofia. 

148
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:57,705
 When the time comes ... 

149
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,760
 ... you will get your daughter ... 

150
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,580
 ... you're going to give the laws. That's all. 

151
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:07,235
 What about you ... 

152
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:09,495
 ... and take the laws and ... 

153
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,920
 ... if I sacrifice my daughter? 

154
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,680
 You will not give up on your dreams of making Sofia the queen of Constantine, Yannez. 

155
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,860
 You are nothing without Sofia. 

156
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,420
 What happens now, sir? 

157
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,000
 Is there any destim, sir? 

158
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,300
 You're coming. 

159
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,460
 Slowly, what is this state? 

160
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,180
 Time is not time to be slow, sir. 

161
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,765
 Gündüz has become the beginning of Gündüz. 

162
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,820
 Tell me. 

163
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,925
 Guys I ... 

164
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,220
 ... We found two Alps of Gündüz Bey. 

165
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,920
 There is no trace from Gündüz Bey. 

166
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,440
 Who killed? 

167
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,320
 We don't know, sir. 

168
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,260
 Why did he come out of the day? 

169
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,340
 Where would he go? 

170
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:06,545
 He found Osman and went to join Osman's cengine. 

171
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,580
 Have you grown in cengi now? 

172
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,215
 His war is different ... 

173
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,100
 ... is our cultivar separate? 

174
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,965
 HE. 

175
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,300
 It's separate. 

176
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,620
 When Kayı chose Mongolian, our ceremony was reserved. 

177
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,335
 Our unofficial person is also separate. 

178
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,480
 Then when your head is stuck ... 

179
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,020
 ... I burned Why do you run to my door because of Allah? 

180
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,960
 Why can't you ask Osman for help? 

181
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,440
 Osman is on the run. 

182
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,680
 If you search, you won't find it. 

183
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,260
 If you found ... 

184
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
 ... You can not keep. 

185
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,020
 Even when you're in trouble ... 

186
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,360
 ... you don't pay allegiance ... 

187
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,440
 ... you take refuge in my principality. 

188
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,040
 At that time... 

189
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,220
 ... look at your state at a turn. 

190
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,875
 Those who follow Osman ... 

191
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,985
 ... where is the door he hopes for ... 

192
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,125
 ... remember it well. 

193
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:12,865
 Let the Alps be thoroughly surrounded. 

194
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,895
 What do you do, sir? Where will you go? 

195
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:25,155
 I must see Balgay. 

196
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:29,905
 Gündüz went after Osman. What should Balgay do? 

197
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,715
 Do you ever say you don't mix it up? 

198
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:36,225
 Mongolian is everywhere, chick. 

199
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:39,245
 Maybe they have something they see and hear. 

200
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,885
 Let's go and learn. Batur ... 

201
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,565
 ... my son will come with me. 

202
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,125
 With thick milk. 

203
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,400
 Mr. Osman. 

204
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,940
 Siblings. 

205
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,820
 I Usman. 

206
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,480
 What did you do, Osman? 

207
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,020
 Yannez accepted my offer. 

208
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,965
 We will trap Balgay. 

209
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,040
 In the end, it's time. 

210
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,380
 What is your intention, Osman Bey, to take Balgay? 

211
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,660
 No. Take your life. 

212
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,075
 Abad with persecution ... 

213
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:18,825
 ... we'll show him that he finally sucks. 

214
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:22,495
 He will see Balgay and his stooges ... 

215
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,445
 ... great plane trees ... 

216
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,995
 ... grows in stormy lands. 

217
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,705
 Those who try to cut our branch ... 

218
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:33,285
 ... we will remove the root from the soil. 

219
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,525
 Oh dear! 

220
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,195
 Allahu akbar! 

221
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,860
 Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! 

222
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,245
 Guys I ... 

223
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,480
 ... Mr. Gündüz ... 

224
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,460
 What happened to my brother? 

225
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,800
 They missed Gündüz Bey, they seek him everywhere. 

226
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,360
 What do you say, Erkut? 

227
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
 Balgay. 

228
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 Balgay! 

229
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,740
 That's Balgay's job. 

230
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:57,725
 He wants to know who sent the news to Geyhatu. 

231
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,075
 To see. 

232
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:05,035
 Come on, valiant, come on! 

233
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,065
 We go to Balgay's quarters. 

234
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,440
 Guys I ... 

235
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,740
 ... wait for the night for the raid? 

236
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,780
 Balgay pus now goes to the castle. 

237
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,160
 He must be holding my brother at the headquarters. 

238
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,060
 It's time. Come on! 

239
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,220
 Thread ... 

240
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:24,975
 ... you stay here. 

241
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:28,135
 A little scratch, sir. 

242
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,045
 You can speak this jackal. 

243
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,855
 This is the dog that killed Köni himself. 

244
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,315
 We need to learn Balgay's games. 

245
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,200
 The information we will take to Geyhatu will pull his rope. 

246
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,800
 Let's. 

247
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:50,605
 He ... 

248
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,060
 ... Topic ... 

249
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,000
 ... keep an eye on him. 

250
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,720
 Thank you sir. 

251
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,200
 What the hell do you do? Tell me. 

252
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,215
 What would you like, chick? 

253
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,845
 You said I'll send clothes to Batur. 

254
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,195
 They ambushed Bala. 

255
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:54,095
 Now Day ... 

256
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:56,845
 ... was attacked for no reason. 

257
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,680
 Well, why? 

258
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,860
 Who is under them? 

259
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,460
 Enough. 

260
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,480
 That will not do. 

261
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,100
 If you are involved in these, 

262
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,520
 ... I'll scrape those eyes, Zöhre. 

263
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,440
 What do you imply, chick? 

264
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,420
 What matters is not what I imply. 

265
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,260
 The important thing is the anxiety you can't hide. 

266
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:51,045
 What have you done to Sofia? 

267
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
 It seemed out of war. 

268
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,920
 He deserved. 

269
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,960
 You all ... 

270
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,980
 ... can you give it what you deserve, Bala? 

271
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,580
 You should also give Osman Bey the right, Bala. 

272
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,260
 Your love is not the love that will lose. 

273
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,215
 I thought a lot, Gonca. 

274
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:20,635
 If I was married to Osman when I was in this state ... 

275
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,020
 ... it would be unfair to him. 

276
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,460
 No, Balaam. 

277
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,135
 If you tell Osman Bey about the situation ... 

278
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:30,005
 ... no injustice. 

279
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:33,095
 Of course I won't marry Gonca. 

280
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,480
 That's not the point. 

281
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,140
 Even if I say, Osman does not give up. 

282
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,440
 He does not leave his love. 

283
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:48,985
 Then... 

284
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,555
 ... wants time over time. 

285
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,240
 Whether it. 

286
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,460
 It is right. 

287
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,340
 Then it takes either a chick. 

288
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,455
 Either he agrees to life without children. 

289
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,025
 Then what happens to us, Gonca? 

290
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:33,955
 Talk Day! 

291
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,100
 What did you tell Geyhatu Gündüz? 

292
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,620
 Did you tell Geyhatu that the laws were in Balgay? 

293
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,120
 Say... 

294
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,980
 ... Balgay ... 

295
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,260
 ... Geyhatu the ... 

296
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,180
 ... turns around after him. 

297
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,120
 If I were you, I would talk before Balgay came. 

298
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,000
 Think about what he will do to you. 

299
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
 Think about it. 

300
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,220
 Cerkutay ... 

301
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,965
 ... take my life. 

302
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,120
 Otherwise, you should know that I don't put this next to you. 

303
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,900
 You know. 

304
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,180
 Take my life. 

305
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,400
 Your death will not be easy Day. 

306
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
 But not my hand. 

307
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,960
 From Balgay's hand. 

308
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,700
 Writhing. 

309
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,400
 Slowly. 

310
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,620
 Mr. Gündüz ... 

311
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,260
 ... God help you. 

312
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,440
 Beyim has tied Gündüz Bey in the square. 

313
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,200
 The Cerkutay dog ​​torments him at the beginning. 

314
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,560
 That's what it means to hurt Bala. 

315
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,800
 He thinks that it was my brother who brought news to Geyhatu. 

316
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,140
 Gündüz Bey also does not speak to the Oba not to feel bad. 

317
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,540
 You are watching the way. 

318
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,420
 Thank you sir. 

319
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,900
 You should listen to me well. 

320
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:49,385
 There are sentry sentries posted around the headquarters. 

321
00:33:57,655 --> 00:34:00,145
 The troops of Balgay are also patrolling. 

322
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,505
 Eighty neutrals exist in Söğüt. 

323
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,575
 So much went to the castle. 

324
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:19,195
 There are also a large number of soldiers at the headquarters. 

325
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,225
 We will crash into the hills like lightning at once. 

326
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:36,855
 Samsa Bey ... 

327
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,625
 It will come by the orient and garp of the Alps. 

328
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,240
 Thank God for my Lord who does not blind my pus. 

329
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,180
 Come on then valiant. 

330
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,580
 Let's. 

331
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,380
 I can't see the tekfur that will pay me allegiance. 

332
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,940
 Where are they, Yannez? 

333
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:37,065
 They came. 

334
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,965
 They said they would pay you allegiance. 

335
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:43,575
 They brought their gifts. 

336
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,235
 You... 

337
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,305
 I said where are they 

338
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:50,115
 ... Yannez. 

339
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:58,265
 I sent them all back. 

340
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:03,425
 Look at me, old man ... 

341
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:06,115
 Do you play Balgay? 

342
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:11,795
 Osman... 

343
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:14,635
 What happened to Osman? 

344
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:17,715
 my daughter caught Sofia. 

345
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,695
 Where is Osman? 

346
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,740
 He was here a little while ago. 

347
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,680
 Osman came to his feet. 

348
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,260
 You left him too? 

349
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,580
 Don't forget, my daughter ... 

350
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,055
 ... your queen is in your hand. 

351
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:54,845
 For Sofia ... 

352
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,335
 What did he ask you for? 

353
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:00,445
 You. 

354
00:37:02,825 --> 00:37:05,175
 For my daughter's life ... 

355
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:08,105
 ... wanted your life. 

356
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:16,965
 What did you say? 

357
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:23,695
 If I kill Balgay while he is a guest on the pen ... 

358
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:28,145
 ... that Geyhatu would destroy the castle. 

359
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:33,415
 You said it right. 

360
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:41,075
 O Osman ... 

361
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,400
 ...what did he say? 

362
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,920
 I will do this work. You just bring it to me, take your daughter, he said. 

363
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,460
 Where to take it ... 

364
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,800
 ... you will throw me in the lap of Osman? 

365
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:58,615
 Tomorrow he will go to İnegöl tekfur ... 

366
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:02,195
 I said that the castle would collapse. 

367
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:04,405
 He is in the gate on the way to the castle 

368
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,565
 ... he will trap you. 

369
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:10,615
 You said good. 

370
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,540
 You will bring Osman back to me so I can take my daughter away from you, Balgay. 

371
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,020
 If my daughter dies ... 

372
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:24,345
 I'll bury Constantinepolis dreams. 

373
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,560
 Know it. 

374
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,160
 Osman. 

375
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,000
 They're Balgay's prisoner! 

376
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
 Osman. 

377
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,000
 What did you do bro? 

378
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,400
 You mind ... 

379
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,220
 ... did you add to dry bread, brother? 

380
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,020
 What are you doing here? 

381
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,980
 Brother... 

382
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
 ...are you okay? 

383
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
 Are you okay, brother? 

384
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,380
 I had a hope until you came ... 

385
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,220
 ... no more. 

386
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:55,805
 Samsa Sergeant. 

387
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:09,475
 The Bams. 

388
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:22,895
 Osman. 

389
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:43,175
 I knew you would make a madness for your brother ... 

390
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:45,555
 I wouldn't expect that much. 

391
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:48,815
 Bravery doesn't even suit your mouth. 

392
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:52,195
 Your bravery for lonely girls ... 

393
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:54,295
 ... take it off to tied hands. 

394
00:42:57,935 --> 00:43:00,015
 I missed Bala Hatun. 

395
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,480
 But you will not be able to escape. 

396
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,620
 You will die with your brother. 

397
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,740
 You came to Balgay's hell with your own foot. 

398
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,700
 Hang them on the hooks. 

399
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,040
 Let their meat be hung until it gets tasted. 

400
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,020
 As for Balgay, we have a feast. 

401
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,080
 I will prepare you such a feast. 

402
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,860
 You can't get enough of your own flesh. 

403
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,820
 Instead of who ... 

404
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,060
 I will drink your own blood. 

405
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:03,425
 Hang Osman first. 

406
00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:15,945
 Either freedom ... 

407
00:44:16,265 --> 00:44:17,845
 ... martyrdom. 

408
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,365
 Mahallah like a fortress wall. 

409
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,660
 Fortunately, we took our precaution. 

410
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,760
 Allahu akbar! Shoot the coach brave! 

411
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,280
 Shoot the valiant! 

412
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,020
 Osman... 

413
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,620
 Alişar Bey came out somewhat darker than I thought. 

414
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,100
 No one dared to press Balgay's headquarters to this day. 

415
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,600
 It is Melik. 

416
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,880
 He is so blind that he is too blind to see even the trouble coming to himself. 

417
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,300
 When hearing what happened, Geyhatu will pull the rope of Balgay himself with his own hands. 

418
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,800
 Until that beautiful day ... 

419
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,860
 ... I will bury Osman and Dündar. 

420
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,960
 We came here to carry soil to the grave of our enemies. 

421
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,200
 Look at the wisdom of Allah that ... 

422
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,600
 ... before us, our enemies buried each other. 

423
00:47:01,245 --> 00:47:02,245
 My brother. 

424
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:22,095
 Big brother, big brother. 

425
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,980
 Osman. 

426
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,080
 Are you okay, brother? 

427
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:52,665
 I'm fine, brother, I'm fine. 

428
00:47:56,765 --> 00:47:57,865
 Mr. Bamsı ... 

429
00:47:58,865 --> 00:48:00,015
 ... my brother is entrusted to you. 

430
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:21,155
 Melik, take out the dishes from the majesty ... 

431
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,405
 ... let's enjoy the view. 

432
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:25,620
 Let's watch the roar. 

433
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 Bey. 

434
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,540
 You call it valiant ... 

435
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,760
 Cerkutay, whirling. 

436
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,480
 When you see it sooner ... 

437
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,260
 ... the crap flowed from his stance. 

438
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,060
 Come on, Turkish. 

439
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,620
 Take a taste of my pusat that has shed the blood of many beeches. 

440
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,940
 Come on. Come on blood shit. 

441
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,280
 Come on ... 

442
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,000
 ... the calculation of the blood of all the valiant ... 

443
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,020
 Give me ... 

444
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,320
 This is for Bala. 

445
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,520
 This is for my brother. 

446
00:49:57,115 --> 00:49:59,885
 This is for many brave people. 

447
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,515
 Our account is not over with you Cerkutay. 

448
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,940
 He's not finished. 

449
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,180
 Shoot the valiant! 

450
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,240
 We crossed the snowy mountains. 

451
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,340
 We were Boran and overflowed Bamsı Bey. 

452
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,560
 We hired the camps, Samsa Bey. 

453
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,700
 Hey, thank you. 

454
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:23,165
 Brother. 

455
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:31,865
 My Osman remained on carrion. 

456
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:33,495
 Let's be thesis. 

457
00:51:34,005 --> 00:51:36,215
 Let's go before Balgay iti come from the castle. 

458
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,080
 Erkut. 

459
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,460
 Guys I ... 

460
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,840
 ... Dundar Bey and Batur Bey come, and we have horses with him. 

461
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,140
 Erkut ... 

462
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,940
 ... take Gündüz Bey. 

463
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,360
 Osman... 

464
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,360
 ... let's not do this, brother. 

465
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:25,765
 You can leave before Balgay comes, brother. 

466
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,340
 It's account time. 

467
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,720
 Mr. Dundar. 

468
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,220
 Ya Shafi. 

469
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,060
 Ya Shafi. 

470
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,000
 Ya Shafi. 

471
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,900
 Healing is only from you, my Lord. 

472
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:33,385
 Brother. 

473
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:41,815
 Brother, are you okay? 

474
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:47,575
 I don't feel anything from the sting of my heart, brother. 

475
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:51,475
 My brother will pass. All will pass. 

476
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:54,075
 We will overcome them. 

477
00:53:55,495 --> 00:53:57,825
 How did I get so heedless? 

478
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:03,165
 How did I do this to you, brother? 

479
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:05,725
 I göktug ... 

480
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:09,865
 ... let's look at the end of a job, not the end. 

481
00:54:10,235 --> 00:54:12,975
 Look, it's finally beautiful. 

482
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:14,345
 We achieved. 

483
00:54:14,725 --> 00:54:16,205
 This is the important thing. 

484
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:18,655
 If only... 

485
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,835
 ... I wish our mother was our father ... 

486
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:25,055
 ... brother had seen us shoulder to shoulder like this. 

487
00:54:26,465 --> 00:54:28,035
 They didn't, brother. 

488
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,580
 They saw this a lot. 

489
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,020
 Home us, our father ... 

490
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:38,635
 ... the Mongols burned us. 

491
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:43,655
 But you are not worried. 

492
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,080
 It will be beautiful beyond that. 

493
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,640
 How will it be brother? 

494
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,680
 How is it going to be? 

495
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,300
 I got into the blood of so many people. 

496
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,800
 I was cruel. 

497
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:56,645
 Does Osman Bey forgive me? 

498
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,140
 My Osman Bey is as merciful as he is fair. 

499
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,800
 Stop it. 

500
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,300
 Let the crowd at your head break. 

501
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:10,915
 When we explain it, it will surely understand us. 

502
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:15,485
 Balgay. 

503
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:18,135
 Balgay does not leave a dog. 

504
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:19,955
 I know it. 

505
00:55:20,595 --> 00:55:22,435
 He will not digest it. 

506
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,380
 Not Balgay ... 

507
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,320
 ... by removing nine swabs and the sentence coming over Mongolian ... 

508
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,640
 ... I still don't give you, brother. 

509
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,500
 We forgot the wound from the longing for brotherhood. 

510
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,000
 I'll go get you some ointment. 

511
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,720
 Let's drive. 

512
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,240
 My brother. 

513
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:19,655
 Hope. 

514
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,080
 Father... 

515
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,720
 what happened here? 

516
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,660
 God... 

517
00:57:11,735 --> 00:57:15,045
 ... bless us from the evil of my mind, son. 

518
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:16,575
 Osman? 

519
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:19,385
 How does he do that? 

520
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
 Obviously... 

521
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,240
 Samsa's alps ... 

522
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,340
 ... entered service. 

523
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,520
 How long does this go like this, Dad? 

524
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,040
 We have to stop Osman. 

525
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,460
 Either we will stop Osman ... 

526
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
 ...or... 

527
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,900
 Balgay's anger ... 

528
00:57:40,275 --> 00:57:41,455
 ... will shoot us. 

529
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,455
 Osman. 

530
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,340
 You were like this when you were little. 

531
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,060
 Is somewhere aching or whining ... 

532
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:34,245
 ... you would have been said to spoil. 

533
00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:41,445
 The Mongolian dog took my mind. 

534
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,420
 I hardly remember those days. 

535
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,540
 I göktug ... 

536
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,380
 ... you dismantled the shackles in your soul ... 

537
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,160
 ... nothing will happen to you informally. 

538
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,640
 Is it good? 

539
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,960
 Good brother. 

540
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,840
 I never reach. 

541
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,840
 I'll tell you all. 

542
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,420
 Home us, our father, our obama ... 

543
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,100
 I will even tell you about the wars we made with wooden swords. 

544
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:27,195
 I'll remind them all. 

545
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,660
 I took your hand ... 

546
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,780
 ... I will not let it go again, brother. 

547
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,640
 Thank you bro. 

548
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,280
 Thank you my brother. 

549
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,600
 My brother. 

550
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,360
 So finally ... 

551
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,120
 ... you did that too, Osman? 

552
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,360
 Now... 

553
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,920
 ... from Balgay's hand ... 

554
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,820
 Who will save you? 

555
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,000
 Who will save you from my hand Dundar Bey? 

556
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,900
 What is that? 

557
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,580
 Are you afraid that your master who kept his halves will be killed? 

558
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,380
 Batur! 

559
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:18,465
 Stop it, son. 

560
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,420
 He sealed his death warrant. 

561
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,080
 You will not find your hand in sister blood. 

562
01:01:30,245 --> 01:01:33,005
 The honored blood of Atam Süleyman Şah ... 

563
01:01:33,095 --> 01:01:34,705
 .. if I don't buy from you ... 

564
01:01:35,455 --> 01:01:36,455
 ...me too... 

565
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,560
 ... Ertuğrul Gazi son Osman should not say. 

566
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,240
 Where is the daytime? 

567
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,720
 I got it in my brother's hands. 

568
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:55,695
 What would they want from your brother? 

569
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,000
 They asked for their trouble. 

570
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,640
 Now it's your turn. 

571
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,480
 Ah... 

572
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,300
 Osman ah! 

573
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,680
 Ah! 

574
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,660
 Me with you... 

575
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,585
 What am I gonna do? 

576
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,840
 You sure you would. 

577
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,240
 My father's coat ... 

578
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,740
 ... you sold it to Mongolian. 

579
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,620
 Then you were built on it. 

580
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,620
 I did it for our obese. 

581
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,660
 I did it for you. 

582
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,260
 Following you ... 

583
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,980
 ... all the stout ... 

584
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,120
 ... I did it to save your life. Don't you still understand? 

585
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,940
 HE? 

586
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,840
 Your goodness, sink, Dundar. 

587
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,640
 If you cut us with pusat in your waist ... 

588
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,320
 ... you would have a memory in your eyes. 

589
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:56,560
 But Dundar Bey, now you are nothing big in our eyes. 

590
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,180
 What about the state ... 

591
01:02:59,595 --> 01:03:01,665
 ... or the raven carrion. 

592
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:12,245
 How many of our heroes died because of you. 

593
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,835
 When will Osman's blood fall into your eyes? 

594
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,520
 When will it fill? 

595
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,540
 Martyrs they are martyrs. 

596
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,040
 But people like you don't understand. 

597
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,700
 They don't know Dündar Bey. 

598
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,340
 Samsa Bey ... 

599
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:36,985
 ... Mr. Bamsı ... 

600
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:39,895
 how is this beylik? 

601
01:03:40,345 --> 01:03:41,955
 How is this beylik? 

602
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,120
 So much of Mongolian's death ... 

603
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,620
 ... how are we going to pay? 

604
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,640
 We will pay the price with the blood of our martyrs. 

605
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,280
 This land conquered by my father ... 

606
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,860
 ... we will not sacrifice those sold like you. 

607
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:21,105
 Alps... 

608
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,925
 ...kill them all. 

609
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,520
 Do not force Demirci Bey. 

610
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,920
 I said do not force Demirci Bey. 

611
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,240
 I said do not force. 

612
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,260
 Storm... 

613
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,140
 ... I would like Dündar Bey alive. Come on! 

614
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,180
 Thank you sir. 

615
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,265
 He's gone this way. 

616
01:09:01,145 --> 01:09:02,265
 Lets hurry up. 

617
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:03,735
 Let's. 

618
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,080
 Mr. Alişar ... 

619
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,620
 ...you huh. 

620
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:26,480
 You know you're coming from this side. 

621
01:09:38,025 --> 01:09:39,215
 Run Melik ... 

622
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:42,385
 Osman, let Batur follow you. 

623
01:09:42,385 --> 01:09:45,105
 You will lose track of the stream there. 

624
01:11:12,025 --> 01:11:13,195
 This is not a trail of Batur. 

625
01:11:18,615 --> 01:11:19,615
 This is another. 

626
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:21,495
 Who is it? 

627
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,760
 Batur! 

628
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,800
 Thank God we don't have a loss, sir. 

629
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,980
 Boran brother is after Dündar Bey. 

630
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,080
 Dumrul will fall into my hand sooner or later. 

631
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,420
 Soon or later. 

632
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,140
 Let's. 

633
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,200
 Hoo! 

634
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,540
 What is that? 

635
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,580
 My Sancak Bey has a horse-like state. 

636
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,280
 Osman. 

637
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:24,325
 Osman. 

638
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,060
 What happened to Osman? 

639
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,440
 Osman... 

640
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,820
 attacked his headquarters. 

641
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,080
 He killed all his posts. 

642
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,280
 Now he's after my son. 

643
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,960
 Let me, let me track you with your sneakers. 

644
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,640
 Do you know what you're saying? 

645
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:52,435
 You've heard it. Let me ... 

646
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:54,545
 ... I'll go after my son with your warnings. 

647
01:12:57,635 --> 01:13:00,715
 Neutrals, go after Osman. 

648
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:02,985
 Dündar Bey will scout you. 

649
01:13:02,985 --> 01:13:04,380
 Hurry up! 

650
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,700
 Balgay, Where is Balgay Gündüz? Why did you miss my nephew? 

651
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,560
 What do you want from him? 

652
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:13,575
 Genghis Khan's laws ... 

653
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,060
 ... he was the one who informed Geyhatu. 

654
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,080
 The end of who betrayed me ... 

655
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,160
 Dundar Bey is death. 

656
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,260
 I am Osman. 

657
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,740
 Lets go! 

658
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,320
 Lets go! 

659
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,100
 Day, nephew. 

660
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,580
 I hope you are aware of the ringing you fell. 

661
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:46,895
 Lift your head. 

662
01:14:48,245 --> 01:14:49,725
 You lift your head. 

663
01:14:52,815 --> 01:14:54,095
 Answer me. 

664
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,400
 Why would you like the cruelty? 

665
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,680
 For what? 

666
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,480
 We're scared, sir. 

667
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,905
 Brave once ... 

668
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,040
 ... cowards die every day Şahin Bey. 

669
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,780
 Beech gentlemen are always dignified. 

670
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:22,475
 It will be upright. 

671
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:32,365
 Now... 

672
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,100
 ... you are in good memory ... 

673
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,420
 ... you can see well. 

674
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:45,535
 The wrongdoing of the bees, whose reputation you have made, 

675
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,185
 ... we got into their lair. 

676
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:52,505
 You fight us, dry fight ... 

677
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:54,875
 ... do you think he will fight raw? 

678
01:15:56,925 --> 01:15:59,695
 This fight is superstitious with Truth ... 

679
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,920
 is a fight between oppressed and oppressed. 

680
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,520
 Bondage traps set up in Turk are abundant. 

681
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,240
 I will note that the Turkish will not surrender, sentence cihana. 

682
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,200
 I swear on my black pus ... 

683
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,300
 I will flag the sky and flag the sun. 

684
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,780
 My damn wasted cruel ... 

685
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,980
 ... there will be hope for the oppressed. 

686
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,300
 Allahu akbar! 

687
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,740
 Allahu akbar! 

688
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,480
 Allahu akbar! 

689
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,040
 Allahu akbar! 

690
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,520
 Allahu akbar! 

691
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,220
 Allahu akbar! 

692
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,560
 I Uthman ... 

693
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,680
 what are we gonna do? 

694
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,140
 Let them go to the place. 

695
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:55,220
 ... if you come across this one more time ... 

696
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,820
 ... then I can forgive you. 

697
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,060
 Bey. 

698
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,720
 Balgay comes here. 

699
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,580
 Crowds. 

700
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,280
 We prepared such a welcome for him. 

701
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,780
 To see. 

702
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,540
 To see. 

703
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,760
 Let's. 

704
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,060
 What do you want, Alişar from me? 

705
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,360
 I saved you from Osman. 

706
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,300
 Is not it enough? 

707
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,700
 You have no judgment on this land. 

708
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:25,220
 Especially there is no one on me, Alişar. 

709
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,060
 Wow Wow wow. 

710
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:30,155
 So I have no judgment? 

711
01:18:32,725 --> 01:18:34,105
 In this land ... 

712
01:18:34,425 --> 01:18:36,705
 ... do you think your father has a judgment? 

713
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:42,585
 Don't make me laugh. 

714
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,355
 First of all, your father's stardom ... 

715
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,680
 ... know that you owe your mother ... 

716
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,820
 ... speak like that. 

717
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,300
 How about you? 

718
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,240
 If Anan didn't sell his soul to Balgay ... 

719
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:06,115
 ... your father only dreamed of starboard. 

720
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,740
 You lie. 

721
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,280
 Anan to save you from Osman's hand ... 

722
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,620
 ... went first and sold Bala Hatun. 

723
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:16,300
 Then Gündüz Bey to save your father. 

724
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,780
 Gündüz Bey, who told Geyhatu about the laws of Cengiz, lied. 

725
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,340
 How do you know them? 

726
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,920
 Don't you know my ear is a hole? 

727
01:19:27,335 --> 01:19:30,055
 I have eyes and ears everywhere. 

728
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,565
 Still haven't learned? 

729
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,420
 As for your father ... 

730
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,800
 ... for the gentleman of Gündüz Bey oba ... 

731
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,500
 ... was brave enough to sacrifice himself. 

732
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,720
 He didn't say Balgay single. 

733
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,580
 Your father did not gamble. 

734
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,460
 However, your dad ... 

735
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,820
 ... oh that poor ... 

736
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,080
 ... your cowardly father. 

737
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,200
 I came here friendly. 

738
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,060
 What do you want, Alişar from me? 

739
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,500
 Where is Bala Hatun? 

740
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,660
 Say your place, let's get paid. 

741
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:25,215
 Go to Oban. 

742
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:29,335
 Witness what I say is truth. 

743
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,480
 I ask for the last time. 

744
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,580
 Where is Bala Hatun? 

745
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,660
 I don't know where Bala Hatun is. 

746
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:50,405
 I don't owe you either. 

747
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,540
 If you are a son ... 

748
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,900
 ... die right. 

749
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,980
 On my way ... 

750
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,260
 Osman became an enemy to your father. 

751
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,060
 Thanks to you ... 

752
01:21:13,405 --> 01:21:15,575
 Dundar will be an enemy to Osman. 

753
01:21:15,925 --> 01:21:18,295
 They will shed each other's blood. 

754
01:21:19,015 --> 01:21:21,375
 Then Geyhatu ... 

755
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,860
 ... Balgay's account ... 

756
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,380
 ... to see. 

757
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,500
 All of my enemies ... 

758
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,620
 ... I will break each other. 

759
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,940
 Bastard! 

760
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,340
 Let it lie down. 

761
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,980
 Leave this push carcass close to the oba in the morning. 

762
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,020
 Let it be watered with sister blood ... 

763
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,580
 ... my sanjid principal. 

764
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,300
 Stop, you're stuck. 

765
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,540
 Is there any water, brother? 

766
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,700
 You want your brother to pierce the mountains and bring water. 

767
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:24,445
 You were like this when you were young, did you want something ... 

768
01:23:24,445 --> 01:23:27,220
 ... innocent innocent brother who narrows his eyes ... 

769
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,780
 Fool. 

770
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,475
 Erlik Han ... 

771
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,540
 Send me your anger from the spirits! 

772
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,820
 Erlik Han ... 

773
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,760
 ...you... 

774
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,460
 ... I said to meet Osman. 

775
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,280
 It turns out ... 

776
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:06,060
 ... I said you are saturated with black blood. 

777
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,860
 It turns out ... 

778
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:14,940
 I said to the blue sky full of the breath of death. 

779
01:27:19,895 --> 01:27:21,365
 Erlik Han ... 

780
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,940
 ... or take my soul ... 

781
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,260
 ... or me ... 

782
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:32,080
 ... give Osman. 

783
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,680
 Get up. 

784
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,780
 While Osman obama was pressing ... 

785
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:32,520
 what the hell do you do? 

786
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,640
 Cerkutay. 

787
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:59,280
 What the hell would you do Cerkutay? 

788
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,820
 They were very crowded, Balgay. 

789
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,340
 Samsa's alps also joined him. 

790
01:29:13,935 --> 01:29:15,415
 Erlik Han ... 

791
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,620
 ... give me Osman. 

792
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,100
 Erlik Han! 

793
01:29:43,815 --> 01:29:44,815
 Bala. 

794
01:29:59,035 --> 01:30:00,975
 I was going to ask how are you 

795
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:03,255
 But I understood when I saw Sofia. 

796
01:30:03,785 --> 01:30:05,445
 You are good. 

797
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,920
 You have a problem. 

798
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,900
 You will not tell. 

799
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,280
 Say, well. 

800
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,600
 Let me level the mountains. 

801
01:30:22,865 --> 01:30:26,145
 Let's not say surviving these days, except surviving. 

802
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,680
 Waits for the bud. Let me help. 

803
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,660
 You're thirsty. 

804
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,360
 You're gone. 

805
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,940
 You ignore me. 

806
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,760
 This is not the case, Bala. 

807
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,600
 What is possible to ignore you? 

808
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:47,685
 Let me leave me for a while. 

809
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,260
 Inform the thesis of Konya. 

810
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,160
 New posts come. 

811
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,640
 If you are clumsy like you ... 

812
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,000
 ... this time I won't leave it to Osman ... 

813
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,040
 ... I kill with my own hands. 

814
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:46,020
 Did Sogut's air soften you too, Kongar? 

815
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:48,220
 Samsa ... 

816
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,680
 ... at the feet of my horse. 

817
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,880
 At the last moment Osman and his alps grew up, Commander Balgay. 

818
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,440
 Cut! 

819
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:00,120
 You couldn't handle a goatherd. 

820
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:02,475
 They were very crowded, Commander Balgay. 

821
01:33:02,495 --> 01:33:04,745
 We didn't even understand where they came from. 

822
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:09,120
 Do not look for the incompetence again. 

823
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,640
 Do not! 

824
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:19,800
 How did you get rid of your hands? 

825
01:33:22,535 --> 01:33:24,435
 You know, Commander Balgay ... 

826
01:33:25,055 --> 01:33:28,095
 ... the chain that will hold me has not been invented yet. 

827
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,360
 Are their locations clear? 

828
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,360
 Their measures are harsh. 

829
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,375
 They took me to Sofia separately. 

830
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:39,785
 The whole forest became a refuge for them. 

831
01:33:39,785 --> 01:33:42,435
 It is impossible to find Osman by searching. 

832
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:07,005
 Commander Balgay, Alişar came. 

833
01:34:08,485 --> 01:34:09,635
 Get on the floor. 

834
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:13,375
 Go prepare for you. 

835
01:34:13,945 --> 01:34:16,765
 We will take the life of Osman tomorrow. 

836
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:21,895
 No it is put ... 

837
01:35:23,005 --> 01:35:24,155
 ...what are you doing here? 

838
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,940
 Where is Kongar? 

839
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,940
 Won't you hear my skin? 

840
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,040
 Beyim Kongar fled. 

841
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,500
 What do you mean? 

842
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,540
 What do you mean? 

843
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:52,780
 Didn't I say open your eyes? 

844
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:54,460
 Didn't I? 

845
01:35:56,075 --> 01:35:57,435
 Sir sir ... 

846
01:35:57,815 --> 01:35:59,135
 ... asked for water. 

847
01:36:00,825 --> 01:36:02,385
 When filling the bowl with water ... 

848
01:36:03,245 --> 01:36:05,005
 ... hit me from behind. 

849
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:07,355
 Didn't you tie him somewhere after we left? 

850
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,740
 Didn't you tie up? 

851
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,920
 I did not connect, sir. 

852
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,520
 Get up! 

853
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:28,875
 You are destroyed in duty, but not in front of me. 

854
01:36:48,635 --> 01:36:49,915
 Kill me, sir. 

855
01:36:50,595 --> 01:36:51,595
 Kill. 

856
01:36:52,645 --> 01:36:54,265
 Why didn't you tie Kongar? 

857
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:57,155
 Why not take your precaution? 

858
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,920
 I can't say thank you sir. 

859
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,760
 I'm looking. 

860
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,240
 What can you say, Konur? 

861
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,160
 What can you not say? 

862
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:13,540
 What can you say, Konur? 

863
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,720
 You will snatch me, Comrade Murderer. 

864
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,800
 Go away, let me see you. 

865
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,220
 I dont go. 

866
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,520
 I don't go anywhere. 

867
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:37,380
 Let my heart be removed from my chest, yet I will not leave your bottom. 

868
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:40,220
 Then why didn't you tie Kongar? 

869
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,080
 For what? 

870
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,960
 Kong ... 

871
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,720
 ... my lost brother is Göktuğ. 

872
01:38:18,545 --> 01:38:21,405
 What news did you bring to me from Konda? 

873
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,160
 I couldn't get to Geyhatu. 

874
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:30,160
 But I heard everything spoken in the palace. 

875
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,220
 Talk. 

876
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:43,540
 He heard that Geyhatu Osman had killed his son Köni. 

877
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,040
 He went crazy. 

878
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,400
 He brought the gold of the palace on him. 

879
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,500
 Not getting his anger ... 

880
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,360
 ... the sultan is said to have killed one of his princes. 

881
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:58,800
 However, he does not see Osman's account ... 

882
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,880
 ... if you don't take the laws away ... 

883
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,380
 ... Geyhatu the ... 

884
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,900
 ... it is said that this will ask you to account. 

885
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,080
 He sent a scout troop to find Osman. 

886
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:11,800
 They will come here at thesis time. 

887
01:39:19,665 --> 01:39:20,785
 The Geyhatu ... 

888
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,540
 doesn't he trust me? 

889
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:29,000
 There is a multi-state palace in Balgay who thinks that Genghis Khan has taken the laws for yourself. 

890
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,380
 Not that... 

891
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:34,300
 ... gossip is not cut back. 

892
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,360
 What does he think? 

893
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,260
 ...I do not know. 

894
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:40,960
 Cut! 

895
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:44,160
 Protect yourself from the wrath of Geyhatu, Balgay. 

896
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:48,200
 I have come a long way now. 

897
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,860
 If you let me ... 

898
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,020
 ... if you don't have a command ... 

899
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,040
 I want to rest. 

900
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:57,120
 I have important jobs tomorrow. 

901
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,640
 When I return ... 

902
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:02,580
 ... I will have new orders for you. 

903
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,900
 I heard that he gave the Sanjak principality to Dundar Bey. 

904
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:16,180
 Until I'm done with him. 

905
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:19,460
 Go. 

906
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,600
 Thank God God has forgiven you. 

907
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,080
 Thank you brother. 

908
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,520
 Day. 

909
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,720
 Aunt. 

910
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,580
 I Aisha ... 

911
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,480
 What are you doing here? 

912
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:17,680
 How did you come? 

913
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,040
 Osman brought it. 

914
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:22,020
 I couldn't stop there. 

915
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,420
 What did they do to you during the day? 

916
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,020
 Whatever they did, they did. 

917
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,860
 My brother pulled me out of this cender. 

918
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,060
 Informal after that ... 

919
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,160
 ... we will look together. 

920
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,820
 May Allah be pleased with you, Osman. 

921
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,440
 God gives shoulder in this war ... 

922
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:49,940
 ... the chick ... 

923
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:50,860
 ... the er ... 

924
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,780
 ... bless you from many valiant brothers. 

925
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,300
 Do I ever protect my brother in the hands of those bastards? 

926
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:12,840
 Welcome, Ayşe Hatun. 

927
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,420
 We're [I'm] glad to be here. 

928
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,140
 May Allah heal at thesis time Gündüz Bey. 

929
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:21,160
 Thank you. 

930
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,520
 Mr. Osman... 

931
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,280
 ... come a little. 

932
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,860
 I have something to say to you. 

933
01:42:45,655 --> 01:42:47,685
 Don't worry, I'm fine. 

934
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,580
 Thank god. 

935
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,560
 Let me say without a shortcut. 

936
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,220
 Understand, Osman Bey. 

937
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,480
 Our companionship will always continue in war. 

938
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,260
 You should not expect anything beyond me. 

939
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:19,100
 I won't leave without saying why, Bala. 

940
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,900
 I was raised for these days. 

941
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,980
 My duty is to stand next to my father ... 

942
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,540
 ... it's time to do my part. 

943
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:35,900
 I realized that love is not my fee. 

944
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,240
 What did you say, Bala? 

945
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,580
 There is something else. 

946
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,100
 There is something else, but you keep it. 

947
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:00,800
 This is beyond. 

948
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,380
 Have a look at another chick. 

949
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:12,140
 There is no good for you Osman Bey. 

950
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,560
 Pususim is always at your disposal. 

951
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,760
 God let him open the way. 

952
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,000
 Where are my dads? 

953
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:50,320
 Don't do Vesvese, Aygül. Set up the table. Now comes your father. 

954
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:55,220
 Father. 

955
01:44:55,725 --> 01:44:56,725
 Bey. 

956
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,020
 What is this state, sir? 

957
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,660
 Osman... 

958
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:12,200
 ... raided Osman Balgay's headquarters. 

959
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,200
 He wanted to kill me with Batur. 

960
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,460
 He chopped our Alps. 

961
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:20,780
 Where is Batur Dündar Bey? 

962
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,180
 He went after Osman Batur. 

963
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:28,280
 With us, we searched everywhere with the guards, but we could not find a trace. 

964
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,440
 Son. 

965
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,500
 My Osman obviously went to get his brother. 

966
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:42,760
 You will become the starboard of ite, who kidnapped Gündüz Bey and killed his alps ... 

967
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,860
 ... then you ask the account of the brother blood from Osman. 

968
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:46,760
 Enough! 

969
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,480
 Get out of our hat, chick! 

970
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:52,140
 When was Otağ yours, babe? 

971
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,020
 Selcan Hatun ... 

972
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:58,420
 ... go away before I have an accident. 

973
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:02,880
 Evvel Bala Hatun is now Day ... 

974
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,700
 Dundar has a big hole in his room. 

975
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:10,280
 Do you stay behind the felt of the couch? 

976
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:14,420
 Can you put on a wing and go to Balgay's ear? 

977
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,460
 What do you mean? 

978
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,520
 Take it out of your mouth. 

979
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:21,520
 What I mean is obvious. 

980
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:24,920
 I came to say that Ayşe Hatun is not in her tent. 

981
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:29,720
 Now I realized that my Osman took Ayşe Hatun with Gündüz. 

982
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,420
 The world of discovery. 

983
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:36,220
 Nice calculation of the blood of our alps ... 

984
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:37,980
 ... not from Osman ... 

985
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:42,500
 ... the day we will ask you comes step by step. 

986
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,660
 You have no heart to hit me. 

987
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:52,980
 Babe ... 

988
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,440
 ... chick get out of here. 

989
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,140
 Get out! 

990
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,540
 Get out! 

991
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,400
 Obama has ... 

992
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:03,920
 ... at our ceremony. 

993
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,700
 Dundar will not let the rest go, the rest is gone. 

994
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:11,920
 The outgoing and the remaining are waiting on the watch. 

995
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,340
 Saltuk ... 

996
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:22,680
 ... alps, get ready for the thesis. 

997
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:25,240
 We will set out to search for Batur Bey. 

998
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,500
 Before Osman died ... 

999
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:29,540
 ... there is no return to oba. 

1000
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:30,760
 This is yours, sir. 

1001
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:13,640
 I Usman. 

1002
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,880
 I Usman. 

1003
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:20,440
 Come on, Osman. 

1004
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:22,115
 You're coming. 

1005
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,300
 I Uthman ... 

1006
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,820
 What is his heart ... 

1007
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,860
 Are you betrayed? 

1008
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:41,320
 Or is he an opponent? 

1009
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,920
 What an opponent breaks my waist. 

1010
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,380
 What betrayal narrows deep. 

1011
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,900
 Bamsı Bey is in my heart. 

1012
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,020
 My heart. 

1013
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,780
 I Uthman ... 

1014
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,240
 ... of Sheikh Edebali ... 

1015
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,520
 ... if it was his consent ... 

1016
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,140
 ... you don't worry. 

1017
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,260
 He is a literary person. 

1018
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,720
 Obviously... 

1019
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:22,060
 Waiting for your vat, Osman. 

1020
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:34,920
 It is not the literary that led me to gamma. 

1021
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,440
 Bala is. 

1022
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,400
 Extinguished heart fire. 

1023
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,480
 He said I don't want you. 

1024
01:49:53,825 --> 01:49:55,775
 First of all, his father saw him missing ... 

1025
01:49:59,385 --> 01:50:00,535
 ... now her daughter ... 

1026
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,960
 now he despises the girl. 

1027
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,520
 I Uthman ... 

1028
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,740
 ... where did he come from? 

1029
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:11,420
 You, you don't make the final judgment. 

1030
01:50:15,935 --> 01:50:17,065
 The verdict is not me ... 

1031
01:50:18,675 --> 01:50:20,365
 ... He gave it to me, Bamsı Bey. 

1032
01:50:22,905 --> 01:50:25,085
 In fact, it is not wrong. 

1033
01:50:26,295 --> 01:50:29,355
 We're on a road that we don't know what will happen tomorrow. 

1034
01:50:30,335 --> 01:50:31,375
 So... 

1035
01:50:33,845 --> 01:50:36,075
 ... so walking with me was heavy for him. 

1036
01:50:38,785 --> 01:50:39,785
 It came heavy. 

1037
01:50:40,805 --> 01:50:41,985
 Son ... 

1038
01:50:43,065 --> 01:50:44,635
 ... I know Bala girl. 

1039
01:50:45,125 --> 01:50:46,735
 I know my daughter Bala. 

1040
01:50:47,275 --> 01:50:49,705
 What is he worrying about tomorrow ... 

1041
01:50:50,105 --> 01:50:51,645
 nor escapes difficulty. 

1042
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:57,440
 Son, you are the clear water of that heart river ... 

1043
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,420
 ... do not mess with occasions. 

1044
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:01,420
 Heart in love ... 

1045
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,540
 his heart carries patience. 

1046
01:51:04,005 --> 01:51:06,925
 Love business is troublesome. 

1047
01:51:13,315 --> 01:51:15,515
 I Usman, both ... 

1048
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:18,760
 ... it seems to me that ... 

1049
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:22,780
 ... there is a job in this. 

1050
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:24,760
 Come out soon. 

1051
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,820
 Vote vote, Osman. 

1052
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:37,340
 Waiting is a fate for his lover, Osman. 

1053
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:40,400
 Joyful... 

1054
01:51:40,715 --> 01:51:42,375
 ... you can patience. 

1055
01:51:42,885 --> 01:51:44,845
 Patience, boy. 

1056
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,200
 My fault. 

1057
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:14,520
 My fault. 

1058
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,580
 My fault. 

1059
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,420
 My fault. 

1060
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:48,220
 Alp is put ... 

1061
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:51,840
 ...Where are you? 

1062
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,760
 Where have I been, Samsa Sergeant? 

1063
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,360
 Say, well. 

1064
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:02,940
 Where was I? 

1065
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,440
 It's my brother. 

1066
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,600
 Where have I been, Samsa Sergeant? 

1067
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,400
 You did whatever you need. 

1068
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:25,040
 Even if you were offended by your own brother, I wouldn't forgive you. 

1069
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,860
 This is a brother. 

1070
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:50,775
 My brother Ala Börü ... 

1071
01:53:51,655 --> 01:53:53,675
 ... I gave the city in the Mongolian raid. 

1072
01:53:55,815 --> 01:53:56,935
 In front of my eyes. 

1073
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,840
 If he was the only survivor, he was mankurt. 

1074
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:13,800
 Wouldn't I turn it into the essence of hitting with those hands? 

1075
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,300
 As long as I knew you were breathing. 

1076
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,980
 Ala Börü is now right. 

1077
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,400
 It's for me ... 

1078
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:37,680
 ... I can't help praying. 

1079
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,020
 But your income. 

1080
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,480
 Take care of your brother. 

1081
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,780
 We are with you. 

1082
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,120
 Believe me, Samsa Bey. 

1083
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:53,660
 He won't believe me. 

1084
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,740
 Thread ... 

1085
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,460
 ... why can't he believe you? 

1086
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:12,860
 Would he ever hurt you if he did not believe me? 

1087
01:55:17,785 --> 01:55:19,215
 You shouldn't worry, I am. 

1088
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,120
 Göktuğ is a valiant mother ... 

1089
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:24,820
 obviously the son of a well-established father. 

1090
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:27,540
 There is also mercy in his heart. 

1091
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,160
 As long as that mercy is there ... 

1092
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:34,180
 ... there will be hope in us. 

1093
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,820
 May you exist, Samsa Sergeant. 

1094
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,560
 May you exist. 

1095
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,180
 May you exist. 

1096
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,415
 Where are the neuters located? 

1097
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:03,360
 They are located right where you say, in the border of Inegol Tekfurlık. 

1098
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:05,900
 Where is our route? 

1099
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:07,400
 Here. 

1100
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,820
 The wolves crossed the hill ... 

1101
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:11,920
 ... we will reach the border. 

1102
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,395
 Which route did the soldiers in Serhat pass? 

1103
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,840
 They passed here. 

1104
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:19,000
 The other way is already long ... 

1105
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:21,020
 ... and he's uncanny. 

1106
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:23,940
 So we too ... 

1107
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:28,560
 ... we will go over the wolves' hill. 

1108
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,180
 With your mind as a bird ... 

1109
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:39,280
 ... you set a trap for me, Osman. 

1110
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:43,060
 This time... 

1111
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,300
 ... you won't get rid of my paw. 

1112
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:00,960
 I told Yannez that I was going to throw the trap into the Inegol border. 

1113
01:57:01,595 --> 01:57:02,635
 Not that... 

1114
01:57:03,475 --> 01:57:04,775
 ... warfare is cheating. 

1115
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:07,805
 We will not set the trap there. 

1116
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,400
 Full ... 

1117
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,120
 ... we will install it on top of wolves. 

1118
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:16,580
 Balgay's headquarters ... 

1119
01:57:16,715 --> 01:57:18,945
 ... a distance from here. 

1120
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,500
 The ambush will never expect it to come from here. 

1121
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:26,180
 We will catch unprepared. 

1122
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:29,540
 If Yannez said the ambush ... 

1123
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:32,100
 ... they have already prepared. 

1124
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:36,320
 Some of the Mongolian warpers have already crossed the hill of wolves and reached the border. 

1125
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:40,580
 Son, we'd say we'd take their heads off the road. 

1126
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:43,880
 Bamsı Bey is the unity bait that I allowed to pass. 

1127
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,040
 Balgay will use that road as they pass that road safely. 

1128
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,400
 At that time... 

1129
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:53,380
 ... part of the shroud ... 

1130
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:55,920
 ... now waits for us in the Inegol border. 

1131
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:58,400
 Because of that, we will be divided into two. 

1132
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:01,955
 Samsa Bey, you and your alps ... 

1133
01:58:01,955 --> 01:58:04,875
 ... where Mongolian soldiers are waiting for us ... 

1134
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:07,320
 ... you will go to Inegol border. 

1135
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,920
 They waited a lot for us. 

1136
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:13,160
 ... you can fill their heads with their sculptures. 

1137
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,580
 Don't bury their bodies in their lair. 

1138
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,320
 Thank you. 

1139
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:41,500
 Selcan Hatun ... 

1140
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,080
 What's up. 

1141
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:46,960
 You fired from the room before ... 

1142
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:50,420
 ... do you intend to fire it now? 

1143
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:56,100
 You will help Selcan Hatun. 

1144
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,040
 I'll help. 

1145
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,860
 You have equalized each thing, Zöhre. 

1146
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,340
 What am I going to do to you? 

1147
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,240
 My Batur still hasn't arrived. 

1148
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,680
 Osman meant it. 

1149
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:17,400
 He doesn't leave his life. 

1150
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:20,500
 Let the news go crazy. 

1151
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,200
 He listens to you. 

1152
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:24,580
 Well! Enough informal. 

1153
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:27,580
 Osman, you howling Osman. 

1154
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:30,860
 Thinking about your own before ... 

1155
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,680
 ... speak like that. 

1156
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,140
 You still say Osman. 

1157
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:38,120
 You couldn't see what that madman went. 

1158
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,900
 What did he do? 

1159
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,240
 What did Osman do? 

1160
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:45,280
 Even if you shed your own. 

1161
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:48,700
 Previously Bala then Gündüz is now Batur. 

1162
01:59:48,705 --> 01:59:51,295
 Go on, let someone else let your news out. 

1163
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:53,600
 Obviously your hand is long. 

1164
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,800
 You will let me know, babe. 

1165
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,960
 If anything happens to my Batur ... 

1166
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,180
 then you see Zöhre. 

1167
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,400
 Our Batur Bey. 

1168
02:00:58,060 --> 02:00:59,640
 They chopped our Batur Bey. 

1169
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,400
 Batur. 

1170
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:37,020
 Batur! 

1171
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:42,440
 Batur! 

1172
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:07,400
 What are you looking at? 

1173
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:10,700
 Let's lift it. 

1174
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:13,220
 Healing come on to the house. 

1175
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:24,060
 It is useful, right? 

1176
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,840
 Is it heavy? 

1177
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:33,120
 Where is his wound? 

1178
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:38,240
 Her mother makes her mother better. 

1179
02:02:39,825 --> 02:02:42,425
 My lamb, my batur. 

1180
02:02:43,235 --> 02:02:44,935
 Where is the wound, my child? 

1181
02:02:45,405 --> 02:02:47,355
 My Batur My Batur. 

1182
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:48,920
 Batur. 

1183
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:51,880
 Baby. 

1184
02:02:56,235 --> 02:02:58,005
 Her mother will do it well. 

1185
02:02:58,505 --> 02:03:00,705
 Her mother is a healer. 

1186
02:03:01,015 --> 02:03:03,895
 Mother, Batu ... 

1187
02:03:03,895 --> 02:03:06,045
 Batur lamb, baby. 

1188
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:09,880
 Open your eyes baby, Yavrum Batur. 

1189
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:11,760
 Open your eyes, lamb. 

1190
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,100
 Zöhre ... 

1191
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:17,420
 ... Batur is gone. 

1192
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,620
 He's dead. 

1193
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,400
 No. 

1194
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,060
 No. 

1195
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,060
 No. 

1196
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:28,340
 No. 

1197
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,860
 No Batur. 

1198
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:35,960
 Lamb open your eyes lamb. 

1199
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:40,740
 Let them see that sky open your lamb. 

1200
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:43,880
 Batur. 

1201
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:45,260
 Batur baby. 

1202
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:49,440
 Baby baby. 

1203
02:03:50,035 --> 02:03:52,865
 Batur. 

1204
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:58,120
 Baby, baby. 

1205
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:03,040
 Oh my baby, I'm Batur. 

1206
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:05,240
 My lamb. 

1207
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,600
 My lamb. 

1208
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:17,800
 They had my mince, Dundar. 

1209
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:19,600
 My lamb. 

1210
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:28,000
 They chopped my puppy. 

1211
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:30,300
 Brother! 

1212
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:34,560
 Big brother open your eyes, big brother. 

1213
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:36,440
 Open your eyes. 

1214
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:41,420
 They had my mince, Dundar. 

1215
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:45,000
 They chopped on my lamb. 

1216
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:45,760
 Vote! 

1217
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:46,940
 Vote! 

1218
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,320
 Open your eyes, brother. 

1219
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:04,500
 Batur. 

1220
02:05:12,075 --> 02:05:13,075
 Son. 

1221
02:05:14,505 --> 02:05:15,505
 I Baturina. 

1222
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
 Son. 

1223
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:24,020
 Son. 

1224
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,580
 Son. 

1225
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:27,420
 My son open your eyes. 

1226
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:31,000
 Look at your hungry son eyes. Your father came, son. 

1227
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,640
 Come on let's open your eyes, we have more work, my Batur. 

1228
02:05:34,645 --> 02:05:36,145
 Come on, son. 

1229
02:05:37,215 --> 02:05:39,735
 My son open your eyes, Batur. 

1230
02:05:40,125 --> 02:05:42,675
 Big brother open your eyes, big brother. 

1231
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:44,500
 Batur. 

1232
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:47,220
 You burned yourself. 

1233
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:50,200
 You burned yourself. 

1234
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,840
 Osman... 

1235
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:00,760
 Osman made this treachery to my son. 

1236
02:06:04,595 --> 02:06:07,895
 Osman made this treachery to my son. 

1237
02:06:08,495 --> 02:06:10,295
 My son open your eyes. 

1238
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:17,400
 Alps... 

1239
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:19,120
 ... I alps ... 

1240
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:21,520
 ... my alps, everyone is out of oba. 

1241
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:25,660
 Everywhere will be sought. 

1242
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:28,260
 Everyone is out of oba. 

1243
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,080
 Oh Osman! 

1244
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,620
 Osman will not stay with you. 

1245
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:41,540
 Will not. 

1246
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:45,480
 I will ask you for the account of my son you murdered. 

1247
02:06:46,005 --> 02:06:49,435
 I will ask Allah is my witness that I will ask you. 

1248
02:06:49,755 --> 02:06:52,425
 I will ask you, I will ask you. 

1249
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:55,860
 Oh my Batur! 

1250
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,500
 Let's! 

1251
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:01,420
 Come on, everyone is on the horse! 

1252
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:02,920
 Let's! 

1253
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,240
 Let's! 

1254
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:23,000
 Brother! 

1255
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:26,100
 Brother! 

1256
02:07:39,015 --> 02:07:41,435
 Kademsiz! 

1257
02:07:42,065 --> 02:07:43,065
 Mother. 

1258
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:50,320
 Go stepless from here. 

1259
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:54,940
 You took my son away. 

1260
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:58,700
 Come on Osman. 

1261
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,560
 Go stepless from here. 

1262
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:04,140
 Come on! 

1263
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,780
 Kademsiz! 

1264
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,200
 Osman! 

1265
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:35,140
 Osman! 

1266
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:02,680
 It could be a trap. 

1267
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:17,120
 Nobody knows we're going through here, Commander Balgay. 

1268
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:19,600
 Who knows where we're going ... 

1269
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:22,760
 Kongar predicts the way we will pass. 

1270
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:28,440
 Unless the skies desire ... 

1271
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,060
 ... happy trees don't fall over. 

1272
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:32,760
 Enemy ... 

1273
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,640
 ... unless the evil spirits touch the hand ... 

1274
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:38,300
 ... happy trees ... 

1275
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:40,460
 ... standing upright. 

1276
02:09:43,535 --> 02:09:44,535
 Remove. 

1277
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:54,960
 Balgay. 

1278
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:57,840
 Osman. 

1279
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:16,700
 What is that... 

1280
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:19,120
 ... are you surprised? 

1281
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:22,120
 After that, to you ... 

1282
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,920
 ... lay hot on black soil ... 

1283
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:27,200
 ... to get up cold. 

1284
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:32,180
 Let the albums collapse Osman on the carcass. 

1285
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:14,480
 You came to Oba with the wrath of Mongolian. 

1286
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:19,955
 Me too, the innocents you slaughtered ... 

1287
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:21,280
 I came with revenge. 

1288
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,300
 Anger's ... 

1289
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:34,020
 ... bigger than revenge. 

1290
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:37,660
 Come on, Osman! 

1291
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:40,880
 We are not afraid of death. 

1292
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:43,440
 He fights with our faith ... 

1293
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:46,360
 ... we chase martyrdom. 

1294
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:48,420
 Allahu akbar! 

1295
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:50,340
 Allahu akbar! 

1296
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:52,240
 Allahu akbar! 

1297
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:54,120
 Allahu akbar! 

1298
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,760
 Allahu akbar! 

1299
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,620
 Allahu akbar! 

1300
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,420
 Allahu akbar! 

1301
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:01,300
 Allahu akbar! 

1302
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,080
 Allahu akbar! 

1303
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,820
 Allahu akbar! 

1304
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:06,620
 Allahu akbar!

1
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
 (I walk in the dark ...) 

2
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,780
 (I lost my shadow) 

3
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 (I threaten the enemy ...) 

4
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,340
 (I lost my friend) 

5
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
 (To the post of my ancestor ...) 

6
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
 (Lambs were established) 

7
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,940
 (Shouting Hürriyet ...) 

8
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
 (I lost my voice) 

9
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,160
 (I have a lot of trouble) 

10
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,440
 (Trap whatever side I look at) 

11
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
 (Whatever side I betrayed) 

12
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,080
 (My heart is heavy) 

13
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,980
 (I hurt) 

14
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,780
 Approaching ... 

15
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,480
 Upcoming Osman. 

16
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,100
 The cruelty will be over. 

17
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,180
 The era is pregnant with a new entry. 

18
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
 As long as you don't sleep. 

19
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
 As long as you sleep, son. 

20
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
 Whatever happens to Oğuz ... 

21
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,960
 It comes asleep. 

22
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,080
 Wake up, boy! 

23
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,140
 Resurrection boy! 

24
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
 My grandfather, my heavenly valiant. 

25
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
 I presented to Osman and his family ... 

26
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
 Pain, torment ... 

27
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,900
 For you. 

28
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,120
 Death... 

29
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,340
 For you. 

30
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,260
 Hear Balgay's voice! 

31
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
 Balgay's gift to you ... 

32
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
 Admit it. 

33
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,600
 Since I entered the service of Genghis Khan ... 

34
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
 The souls I took ... 

35
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
 He gave joy to his palace. 

36
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
 The tears of my victims ... 

37
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
 I couldn't get enough of the river and get ... 

38
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,440
 He gave glory to our souls. 

39
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
 He gave fame ... 

40
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,820
 Now... 

41
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,660
 You... 

42
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,740
 I give Osman. 

43
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,140
 It has no brothers? 

44
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,340
 No, I hope, brother. 

45
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,040
 I am in dream, I am in game. 

46
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,020
 Sir preparations ok 

47
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,820
 We can set off with your command. 

48
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,640
 I don't want any mistakes. 

49
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,320
 We gave Balgay such a force to get our obese ... 

50
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
 Now we have to take that trust. 

51
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,240
 Now let's see what it is to lose those Mongolian dogs. 

52
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,720
 Balgay ... 

53
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,600
 He will drown in his dreams. 

54
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,820
 Thank you. 

55
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,460
 It should be wind and should fear the shroud. 

56
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
 Howling like a wolf ... 

57
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,840
 He must set up the biggest of the cruel ambushes. 

58
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,200
 Zulfikar should cut and bring the order to the world. 

59
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
 Ya Allah! 

60
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
 Preparations are about to be done. 

61
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
 Do you have any other requests, Balgay? 

62
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,220
 I wish... 

63
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
 The great gentlemen of the Oba came and 

64
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,060
 Let see ... 

65
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,400
 Who are the happy relics of Genghis Khan ... 

66
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,680
 Who should see who the monarch ... 

67
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,180
 Let them kneel in front of Balgay. 

68
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
 You have the relics ... 

69
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,460
 When he learns, Geyhatu's anger will surpass the mountains. 

70
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
 They will be enemies to you, Balgay. 

71
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
 An enemy to Balgay ... 

72
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
 You call yourself a friend. 

73
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,940
 I am the new ruler ... 

74
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
 On the road ... 

75
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
 Commanders of my army. 

76
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
 Soon in Constantine ... 

77
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,180
 This alone will be spoken. 

78
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,660
 Beyond empty 

79
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
 Apricot spilled early ... 

80
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,080
 Barren chick ... 

81
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
 It looks like barren soil. 

82
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
 Süçük Dündar. 

83
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,980
 Walk 

84
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
 What are the situations in Söğüt? 

85
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,020
 His room, separated from Balgay Söğüt, was in a secret place. 

86
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 At this end ... 

87
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
 Other than my father's bed, no other bed is established. 

88
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,420
 Whoever installs ... 

89
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
 I make a grave per tent where he takes refuge in his shadow. 

90
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
 They stuck to the market trades like leech, sir. 

91
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
 They plunder their property. 

92
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,380
 What are their troubles? 

93
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,900
 They take food to Balgay, sir. 

94
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
 Mongolians had big heads. 

95
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 Balgay will make a big feast 

96
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
 Those who brought provisions to Balgay ... 

97
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,040
 They take us with him. 

98
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,840
 You understand, I am Konur. 

99
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
 Command me, I'll dig the mountains, sir. 

100
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
 I'll take them off and put them in front of them. 

101
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
 Your one mistake, everything is awful. 

102
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
 Kayı is the chick of the brain ... 

103
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,860
 Why is he in front of me? 

104
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,140
 Supreme Balgay ... 

105
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
 I have something to say to you. 

106
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,740
 What will you say? 

107
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
 But be cautious. 

108
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
 Death from Balgay ... 

109
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,180
 Only when your soul reaches the sky, you understand. 

110
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,780
 I came because of my child. 

111
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 He has gone from Oba. 

112
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,020
 I have no hope other than you. 

113
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,540
 Banane. 

114
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,040
 Banane from your son. 

115
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,180
 He is with my son Osman. 

116
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
 He fights with Osman. 

117
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
 Don't drink my son's blood ... 

118
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,840
 Don't pierce your lungs ... 

119
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,640
 If you want to feed your head to the wolf by wolf ... 

120
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 What do you give in return? 

121
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,420
 Usman. 

122
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,740
 And Edebalı. 

123
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
 You came with the promises. 

124
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
 In return for giving me what I want ... 

125
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
 You want to meet your son. 

126
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
 Those who do not think before promising ... 

127
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
 When he couldn't keep his word ... 

128
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,700
 To cry. 

129
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,820
 You are the smart woman. 

130
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 You know who to pay allegiance. 

131
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,680
 My strength is with you. 

132
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
 Now let me know what I need to know. 

133
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 If you do wrong ... 

134
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,420
 First, I strip Batur's meat from his bones ... 

135
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
 I do not feed my dogs. 

136
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,360
 Do not worry. 

137
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,180
 Zöhre will be loyal to you. 

138
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,180
 The hides I hold on the leash are increasing. 

139
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,860
 Thesis news release ... 

140
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,940
 Let her husband come. 

141
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
 Now Dundar deserved the gift. 

142
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
 Where is your mother? 

143
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 He said he would go to collect herbs for the hospital. 

144
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
 Is it time to collect grass? 

145
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,480
 You know my mom dad ... 

146
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,540
 He can't manage to throw it in. 

147
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,580
 If he can't tell you his problem, he tries to tell the flower to the insect. 

148
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,360
 Gathering herbs is also an excuse. 

149
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,400
 What could he not say? 

150
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,140
 You very much knit my mom, dad. 

151
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
 Don't worry, girl. 

152
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Your mother is the old land. 

153
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
 It does not resemble the brushwood that it collects. 

154
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
 Don't say so, he's broken. 

155
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,640
 You called Hazal hatun and my brother Bahadır. 

156
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
 How quickly did you forget what happened dad? 

157
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,860
 Bey's table is big ... 

158
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
 Bey's room is wide, girl. 

159
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
 For those who know how to make a living ... 

160
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,880
 There is nothing to be offended. 

161
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 Do not overwhelm yourself with these. 

162
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,180
 Eat your vaccine. 

163
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
 Do you think it passes through my throat? 

164
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
 A brother is on the way ... 

165
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
 There is no news from my brother Batur. 

166
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,840
 Is there a destruction? 

167
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,560
 Come Day. 

168
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,240
 You called me, sure. 

169
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,160
 Come. 

170
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,740
 Sit down. 

171
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,460
 Come on. 

172
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,760
 Rather than sure. 

173
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 Your stove is familiar, my nephew. 

174
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,880
 Mongolian everything ... 

175
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It broke everyone. 

176
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
 That is what I mean ... 

177
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,140
 You go to Nikea. 

178
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
 The market of the rate is abundant. 

179
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
 How much goods we have ... 

180
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,600
 Sell ​​less or less. 

181
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,040
 I go away ... 

182
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,520
 Osman. 

183
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,380
 What will Osman be? 

184
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
 Osman... 

185
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
 He punishes his toy. 

186
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
 From this state ... 

187
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
 However, it is saved by penalties. 

188
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,020
 Don't worry, my nephew. 

189
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 I made such a calculation that ... 

190
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,680
 Everyone will get their share. 

191
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,820
 I am ... 

192
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
 Tomorrow one day I will have him in my throat ... 

193
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 I take the heart of Osman. 

194
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,240
 Thank you emmi 

195
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,900
 You exist. 

196
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
 Don't worry, I'm going to set off. 

197
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,240
 Slide the alps patrolling in Oba to the forest side. 

198
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,740
 Against an infiltration ... 

199
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
 May they keep watch at this location. 

200
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,440
 Bey, Bamsı Bey came. 

201
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,440
 buyursun. 

202
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,420
 On which mountain did the wolf die, Bamsı? 

203
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
 Do you know the way to our oba? 

204
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
 There was no way in this land. 

205
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 The realm has changed in the era, Bamsı Bey. 

206
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
 The toy boys have stepped on the bed. 

207
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
 That's why I came, son. 

208
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
 Between Yalçın mountains ... 

209
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,980
 Wild winds have entered. 

210
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 I heard, I was sorry. 

211
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
 What happened to me now? 

212
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
 Put that dagger in my throat! 

213
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Otherwise I will not let you go. 

214
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,840
 Kill me! 

215
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,260
 Don't get on my way again. 

216
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
 Mountain pit we know ... 

217
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
 What we know at the summit is bullshit Bamsı Bey. 

218
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 What the mouth says ... 

219
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,480
 Does your heart have blood? 

220
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,040
 Such things happen among comrades. 

221
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
 But again it is for the road. 

222
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,440
 Osman fell from my eyes and my heart, Bamsı Bey. 

223
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 You are two piles of beech. 

224
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
 Does it suit you? 

225
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,580
 You are comrade! 

226
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,500
 If we were comrades, why would he keep the secret from us? 

227
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
 My Ertuğrul Bey would not tell us everything ... 

228
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,180
 However, we would not have such a heart. 

229
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,840
 Dundar ... 

230
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,420
 When he didn't say the original thing, he exiled him too. 

231
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
 Why didn't you sound? 

232
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,360
 Dundar Bey's judgment is not questioned. 

233
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,440
 Dündar Bey huh? 

234
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,500
 Aha otag. 

235
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,940
 Aha post. 

236
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,380
 In Dundar Bey, are we afraid of idle, Bamsı Bey? 

237
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,320
 When the secret is hidden ... 

238
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,920
 It does not do so. 

239
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
 When the Bey sees an error ... 

240
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,240
 It does not jazz. 

241
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,680
 Bey... 

242
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,120
 Over that error ... 

243
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,740
 It covers like the night. 

244
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 This spear doesn't fit in a burlap, Bamsı Bey. 

245
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,040
 Now Osman is my enemy, nothing more. 

246
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,620
 Stay in between, don't let it splash over the blood to squirt. 

247
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,160
 You're fresh stout ... 

248
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,100
 You'll be the master of this paternal legacy. 

249
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,420
 They didn't teach you ... 

250
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,120
 Or you couldn't record it well, Samsa! 

251
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,060
 I am Gazi Ertuğrul Bey's alpbasi Bamsı Bey. 

252
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,640
 They knit my pusat with blood ... 

253
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,880
 I live with Ecel and sheep. 

254
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,980
 We are adults, we advise you ... 

255
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,880
 You get dark on us. 

256
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,420
 If you continue on this stubbornness ... 

257
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,020
 You'll be left alone. 

258
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
 Liberation to our toy ... 

259
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
 The bird turns to our mourning. 

260
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
 Loneliness is my destiny, Bamsı Bey. 

261
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,780
 There is a lot of labor on us. 

262
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,980
 But if you will undertake this issue ... 

263
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
 The door you entered is there. 

264
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 There are those efforts that I gave ... 

265
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
 Shame on the efforts I made. 

266
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 You've had no time. 

267
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,260
 You forgot the ceremony. 

268
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,380
 Devil's quarters have set up in your heart. 

269
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,720
 Now what if you wash that throne and fire the devil ... 

270
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,940
 Or nobody can save you. 

271
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,500
 Now I'll give you a while. 

272
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,280
 If I see that devil in his heart again ... 

273
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 I wash this bed on its own. 

274
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
 I wash this bed over, Samsa! 

275
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,840
 What have I got, what have you got? 

276
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
 Give me my horses. 

277
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
 Balgay waits for you, Dundar Bey. 

278
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
 Do you know what you want from me? 

279
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,700
 Balgay doesn't want ... 

280
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,080
 Mr. Dundar takes it. 

281
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,240
 It just takes. 

282
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,960
 Stop! 

283
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
 Hang the corpses on the road. 

284
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,080
 Let's see the people passing by. 

285
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,820
 Let's see ... 

286
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,660
 Let the fear of Mongolian dissipate. 

287
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,880
 Let them see that Osman and his alps ... 

288
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
 He resurrected the fire of the resurrection. 

289
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
 Come on, the night will be long. 

290
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,020
 On behalf of Kayı Obasi ... 

291
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
 We came to tell you our biad. 

292
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,360
 Happy commander ... 

293
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,120
 Great Balgay. 

294
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
 Balgay loved you. 

295
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,840
 You started to hit the road, Dundar. 

296
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,940
 You also exiled Osman. 

297
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,600
 Whoever will harm our loyalty to you ... 

298
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
 Kayi can not live in her obe. 

299
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,900
 Whatever your loyalty to Balgay ... 

300
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,260
 The grace of Balgay is so much. 

301
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,040
 Abin Ertuğrul was crying for you ... 

302
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,140
 Kayı has given you the principality of his oban by proxy. 

303
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,220
 Now I'm a father to you. 

304
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
 From now on... 

305
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Not by proxy, 

306
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 You're basically a master. 

307
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,660
 I offered you these gold coins. 

308
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,940
 Spend or distribute. 

309
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,120
 Kayı obasi hide is from my brother Ertuğrul Bey ... 

310
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,420
 Velev does not accept this. 

311
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,220
 Do not be so nervous Dundar. 

312
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
 Especially be calm, Dundar. 

313
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
 Balgay's heart is wide. 

314
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
 All the gentlemen are connected ... 

315
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
 I also gave you Sancak Bey. 

316
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
 Now go to this holy sign ... 

317
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,080
 Take Kayi to her post ... 

318
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
 From where the sun rises to where it sets ... 

319
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,180
 Ruling up anywhere ... 

320
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,800
 The sworn Mongolian might ... 

321
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,100
 Everybody's clear. 

322
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
 Why am I Balgay? 

323
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,460
 Like you... 

324
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,000
 Is there a valiant gentleman that Mr. Dundar? 

325
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,080
 Kayı obasi ... 

326
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,980
 He will always be grateful to you. 

327
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,300
 He doesn't want a crowd. 

328
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,740
 I have heavenly guests, get out of my peace. 

329
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,000
 Laws ... 

330
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,400
 And bring the protective dagger. 

331
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
 Do you see what I see, sir? 

332
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
 If I was blind or not, I would put it. 

333
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,900
 The coyote who stepped on the ground yesterday ... 

334
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,760
 Presents flesh. 

335
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,060
 Obviously... 

336
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,320
 His tongue was faded from pouring tongue into Balgay. 

337
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,960
 His knees rotted before kneeling before him. 

338
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,100
 It also feels like victory over the horse. 

339
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,520
 What the hell is this son doing in his son? 

340
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,000
 One of my father's skins that he did not sell remained. 

341
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,880
 Do you dare to do this? 

342
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
 Our ancestor Cengiz's lineage ... 

343
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,940
 Living in the mountains ... 

344
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
 It is from blue wolf. 

345
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,460
 My face ... 

346
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,500
 Yalanguz ... 

347
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,380
 I will paint blue. 

348
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,020
 The memory of our ancestor Cengiz ... 

349
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,700
 This dagger ... 

350
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,220
 I will carry it with honor. 

351
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,900
 Face flip Selcan Hatun. 

352
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,060
 Don't add a problem to my problem like a mountain. 

353
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,200
 You'd say it wouldn't be like a mountain if you stood right in time. 

354
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
 Whatever I did, I did it from my fear. 

355
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,120
 It happened to me that I was afraid. 

356
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,260
 My son is gone like a lion. 

357
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,280
 Come, Selcan Hatun. 

358
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,740
 I have something to say. 

359
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,860
 Whatever your time is limited, quickly. 

360
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
 Son and father is a gamsa ... 

361
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
 Anaya is a thousand gamut. 

362
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,860
 You understand my situation. 

363
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,920
 May this bundle. 

364
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,240
 What's this? 

365
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,660
 Batur'u to. 

366
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,220
 I do not know your homeland. 

367
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,660
 You are aware of Osman. 

368
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
 You must see and hear. 

369
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,260
 Let them give it to my Batur. 

370
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
 Clean clothes. 

371
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,940
 Zöhre! 

372
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,680
 Don't Selcan Hatun! 

373
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,340
 I know what to say. 

374
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,280
 But your words are not a useful ointment. 

375
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,860
 Dündar Bey refused Batur. 

376
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,640
 Even more so ... 

377
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,320
 He sent news to Bahadır so that he could take his mother. 

378
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,120
 How about you, Zöhre? 

379
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,920
 Is Bahadır and his mother Hazal coming? 

380
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,660
 Wow what happened to us. 

381
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,120
 My victim is Selcan Hatun. 

382
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,380
 Bring this bundle to my Batur. 

383
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
 As for Osman ... 

384
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,800
 Understood. 

385
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,700
 I understood that too ... 

386
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,300
 I also understood why my Batur was after him. 

387
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,800
 I gave it right. 

388
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,700
 If you get news from Osman ... 

389
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,900
 Me too. 

390
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,580
 Just let me know they're fine. 

391
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
 Hopefully Osman is not a madman, brother. 

392
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,440
 Is it a sister from a person who is not crazy? 

393
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,360
 Didn't we keep quiet in the toy to make his heart feel crazy? 

394
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,920
 From the painless man ... 

395
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,460
 No way. 

396
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,220
 All kinds of work are relative. 

397
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,600
 Tomorrow one day this nation ... 

398
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,240
 Hope you brother. 

399
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,480
 Thank you. 

400
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,720
 You're right, Bamsı, brother. 

401
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,380
 But still ... 

402
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,980
 If a trouble comes to our Osman, my heart will burn. 

403
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,720
 The Bams ... 

404
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,920
 My brother... 

405
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
 Do you see what I see? 

406
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
 My brother... 

407
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,460
 Ahanda these eyes ... 

408
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,100
 What betrayals he saw ... 

409
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,860
 He didn't see it that way. 

410
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,760
 What have I seen like this ... 

411
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,960
 Nor heard it. 

412
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,580
 What are we going to do? 

413
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,040
 Valiant gentlemen of beech ... 

414
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,820
 Valiant alps ... 

415
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,660
 And folks ... 

416
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,200
 The Beech ... 

417
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,380
 Next to the Kutlu banner ... 

418
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,580
 Atam Oğuz ... 

419
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,060
 My father suits Süleyman Şah ... 

420
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,980
 I wave another flag. 

421
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,160
 First of all ... 

422
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,720
 You know ... 

423
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,700
 I wanted to be proud of you. 

424
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,520
 My brother ... 

425
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,380
 These lands conquered by Ertuğrul Bey ... 

426
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,840
 I brought another honor. 

427
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,680
 Principality of Sancak ... 

428
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,580
 With the permission of my Lord ... 

429
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,920
 It was given to me. 

430
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,460
 And so a new one for the apricots ... 

431
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,240
 Hope was born. 

432
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,300
 Together with my Sancak Beylik ... 

433
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,120
 Both in this land ... 

434
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,400
 If necessary, our obese ... 

435
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,840
 We live ... 

436
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,700
 The period of the interregnum ... 

437
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,620
 We're at the end. 

438
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,640
 We will work harder ... 

439
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,640
 We will try harder. 

440
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,920
 Sold you. 

441
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,120
 Osman, even if it comes time ... 

442
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,040
 Let this snake down its grandeur. 

443
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,360
 Selcan Hatun is not stop now. 

444
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,280
 The lords of the lords ... 

445
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,100
 And even ... 

446
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,800
 As Sancak Bey of these extreme lands ... 

447
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,840
 My gentleman's thesis ... 

448
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,420
 I wait in my room. 

449
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,480
 With them, they ... 

450
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,720
 His duties have increased. 

451
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,480
 My God... 

452
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,940
 Yar and be our assistant. 

453
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,380
 The laws of Genghis Khan ... 

454
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,560
 It is in Balgay's quarters. 

455
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,240
 Our job will not be easy. 

456
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,460
 Balgay for tonight ... 

457
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,620
 Nice Mongolian invited commander ... 

458
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
 He wants to add strength to his power. 

459
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
 He wants to rise in Mongolian khanate. 

460
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,660
 Not that... 

461
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,480
 We will leave all of them in their crops. 

462
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
 Now the apricot is in the beylik ... 

463
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,020
 In the banner of ... 

464
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,220
 It is probably under. 

465
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,980
 Black days are gone. 

466
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,080
 It has come with its abundance. 

467
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
 Pick up the oba ... 

468
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,500
 To compile the people ... 

469
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,620
 We did not make our voices. 

470
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,640
 But what to put the Mongolian collar on your neck? 

471
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,980
 I have these duties ... 

472
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,340
 I bought it for the peace of the beech. 

473
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,260
 Siblings... 

474
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,440
 Mongolian is much stronger than us. 

475
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,080
 We have no power to deal with it. 

476
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,980
 Can't you still understand? 

477
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,480
 I think of my mind and act ... 

478
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,400
 I want to keep our obesity out of trouble. 

479
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,340
 Why did you get the gold then? 

480
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
 Does liberty cost money? 

481
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,020
 I have been a loser to this place for years. 

482
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,640
 I have not seen such a custom. 

483
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,620
 Kayi is chosen with beys. 

484
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,540
 Who chose you? 

485
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,580
 Who put you in this mail Dundar Bey? 

486
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,420
 What would I do? 

487
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,560
 If I caused a new mause? 

488
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,460
 Beef of the beech ... 

489
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,260
 It was kneaded in the clamp of the scorpion. 

490
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,060
 Even if my neck was broken, 

491
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
 Dundar Bey, if I had not seen he was bowing. 

492
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,180
 Not accepting the duties ... 

493
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,340
 What would Bamsı Bey do not bow? 

494
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,340
 Should we be alone with the persecution of the Mongolian? 

495
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,640
 We also saw the head lift ... 

496
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,980
 Mr. Demirci. 

497
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,220
 The reputation of beech ... 

498
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,340
 They fell to the ground. 

499
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,560
 Balgay to ... 

500
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,080
 They became cargo animals. 

501
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,480
 Mr. Şahin ... 

502
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,940
 Head up and be a load animal ... 

503
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,260
 It is better to bow and leash it. 

504
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:29,780
 Enough! 

505
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,340
 Gather your mouth, Abdurrahman Gazi. 

506
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,840
 No Dundar Bey. 

507
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,180
 Abdurrahman Gazi even said little. 

508
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,820
 Cenkin history ... 

509
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,440
 He writes the defect. 

510
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,120
 He also writes defeat ... 

511
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,940
 Not that... 

512
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,960
 Anemia that takes gold from his opponent ... 

513
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,100
 Dundar Bey does not write it. 

514
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,560
 Even Bamsı Beyrek! 

515
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,040
 Otherwise, what a principality will remain ... 

516
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,500
 Neither your sting. 

517
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,460
 Mr. Dundar ... 

518
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,760
 I was heavy when I martyred this hair my son. 

519
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,400
 If we were going to bow ... 

520
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,220
 If we were going to be ram ... 

521
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,960
 Why did we give so many martyrs? 

522
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,280
 Mr. Dundar ... 

523
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
 Greasy bite of the shroud ... 

524
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,240
 It has seduced your faith in your stout. 

525
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,200
 But you should know. 

526
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,200
 Day and day turns around. 

527
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,920
 These reactions ... 

528
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,640
 Sure, my gentlemen. 

529
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,700
 From the direction we are walking ... 

530
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,920
 We have no doubt. 

531
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,440
 Match these gold to other gentlemen. 

532
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,060
 Here Selcan Hatun ... 

533
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:18,640
 Dundar Bey by walking or crawling? 

534
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,280
 As you know, you have become a Mongolian dog. 

535
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,160
 The ceremony has also changed now. 

536
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,320
 Weigh your words, Selcan Hatun! 

537
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,320
 My limit is raspberry ... 

538
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,420
 The ceremony is Dundar Bey! 

539
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,560
 Hatun, sooner ... 

540
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,760
 You don't mind politics and order. 

541
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,640
 Look at you, I will not break your heart. 

542
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,540
 Hey go hey! 

543
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,580
 Look at the son of Süleyman Şah, Dundar Bey, especially ... 

544
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:50,260
 See what the brain says to glorify the glory of beech. 

545
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,360
 While you were a Mongolian slave ... 

546
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,660
 What should Osman do now? 

547
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,800
 Who should hold Osman now? 

548
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
 From now on, whatever I say! 

549
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,480
 It is Osman who put us in this state. 

550
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,620
 Big oba, let me leave ... 

551
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,580
 Should the Mongols burn and demolish us? 

552
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,260
 Say the glory of beech ... 

553
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:18,160
 While I was trying to prevent our blood from spilling ... 

554
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,140
 Did I crush the glory of the beech? 

555
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,720
 Kayılar took Sancak Bey as the head of this tip. 

556
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,460
 You talk more and you appear exile. 

557
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,100
 Gather your mind. 

558
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,200
 Yet, Mr. Dundar. 

559
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,180
 Stop! 

560
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,140
 You throw everyone money ... 

561
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,360
 First Osman, then Batur and now Selcan Hatun. 

562
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,340
 This chick keeps honor. 

563
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,720
 He thinks of the oba, what does the exile mean? 

564
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,860
 My Batur went after Osman's footsteps. 

565
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,660
 If Selcan Hatun goes ... 

566
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,120
 You know, my daughter and I follow her. 

567
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,960
 What do you want from us, Balgay? 

568
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,900
 What is this rush to discuss with us? 

569
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,440
 The power of the souls ... 

570
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,020
 I got armor. 

571
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,260
 The language of Genghis Khan is my language ... 

572
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,300
 I had my sword. 

573
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,080
 Flowing power in my blood ... 

574
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,040
 It comes from the laws of Genghis Khan ... 

575
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,780
 That's how it is known. 

576
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,880
 Bring the chest! 

577
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,120
 My Batur Bey, keep the pusat ready. 

578
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,320
 We do not go empty, we are put. 

579
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,800
 Who are you? 

580
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
 Osman, son of Ertuğrul Gazi. 

581
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:05,440
 My locusts wait for the chest. 

582
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,560
 It will be worth what they expected. 

583
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
 You get ready for combat. 

584
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,160
 Geyhatu the ... 

585
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,620
 Brave commanders ... 

586
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,680
 Genghis Khan's ... 

587
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,100
 The laws that bear your soul ... 

588
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,340
 Happy birthday of Balgay ... 

589
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,480
 Witness the spirits ... 

590
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,380
 Let my comrade be my comrade. 

591
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,220
 To the power of the law today ... 

592
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,520
 It is a day of obedience. 

593
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
 How about you Balgay? 

594
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,660
 Such a power is only in the grandchildren of Genghis Khan. 

595
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,240
 It's not in your hands. 

596
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,280
 I have the power, Commander! 

597
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,520
 Bitter ... 

598
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,320
 In Balgay. 

599
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,580
 If Balgay is right ... 

600
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,840
 He expects obedience from us ... 

601
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,180
 Or it will take our lives. 

602
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,900
 The ballot box is empty Balgay. 

603
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,520
 Betrayal! 

604
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,060
 Do you play? 

605
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,040
 What do you think Balgay did? 

606
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,660
 Until Genghis Khan found the laws ... 

607
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,960
 You will not go anywhere. 

608
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,900
 Search everywhere. 

609
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,600
 Close all inputs and outputs. 

610
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,780
 The hollow of each tree will be looked after. 

611
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,740
 Search everywhere! 

612
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,120
 There are dead soldiers behind the bed ... 

613
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,700
 They escaped from there. 

614
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,560
 We Peşlerind. 

615
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,060
 Who does this ... 

616
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,260
 There can be no other than Osman. 

617
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,180
 Search everywhere. 

618
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,180
 To the spirit of Atam Cengiz ... 

619
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,920
 I swear ... 

620
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:10,240
 I will separate Osman's meat from his bones. 

621
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,580
 Drink your blood ... 

622
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,780
 I will feast on their meat. 

623
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,880
 I knew you were ambitious. 

624
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,900
 You always loved the power. 

625
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,780
 But I wouldn't have expected this much. 

626
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,080
 The person should be ready for what he hopes, chick. 

627
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,120
 You were so bored. 

628
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:46,740
 Thinking about what's going to happen now ... 

629
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,560
 Your heart becomes narrow. 

630
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,900
 Am I the new enemy? 

631
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,540
 No. 

632
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,280
 Your eyes are turned. 

633
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,240
 Weren't you ... 

634
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,760
 Kayı is also in Pazu everyone ... 

635
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,700
 But it is only you who says both mind and sun. 

636
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,060
 Let this big oba ... 

637
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,540
 Let me know a little bit from my mind. 

638
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,540
 You couldn't take care of your son as a father. 

639
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,920
 You will be the owner of the oba, huh? 

640
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,040
 I will laugh Dundar Bey. 

641
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,600
 You said Beylik for years ... 

642
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,260
 You said power 

643
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,080
 Take it, beylik ... 

644
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,160
 Take it to you. 

645
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,120
 There is the door to the dislikes. 

646
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,240
 Enough of the teran. 

647
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,220
 How happy you are ... 

648
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,380
 You have claimed the trust. 

649
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,140
 You made the enemy brutal. 

650
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,280
 Thank God, my Sheikh. 

651
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,980
 This life, this world ... 

652
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:13,260
 This creature and nabula ... 

653
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
 It is entrusted to man. 

654
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,340
 So human ... 

655
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,140
 He must always be sure. 

656
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,180
 To the relics given to him ... 

657
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,080
 You should claim. 

658
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,080
 How do we protect the relics? 

659
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:33,140
 Adopted by being human. 

660
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,560
 Aren't we human? 

661
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,540
 Your body is so ... 

662
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,120
 What about your mind? 

663
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,640
 What about spiritually? 

664
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,720
 What about your heart? 

665
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,240
 We came to the world as a human. 

666
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,620
 Will we go as a human? 

667
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,920
 To the eternal realm? 

668
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,180
 What kind of land ... 

669
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,300
 If there is a route to go to a land ... 

670
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,880
 If there is a scientific method ... 

671
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,740
 To the eternal realm ... 

672
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,060
 Going as a human ... 

673
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,260
 There is a way procedure, of course ... 

674
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,200
 What's the way to this, Sheikh? 

675
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,540
 Take care of safety, son. 

676
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,600
 To begin with .. 

677
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
 We will keep our hearts clean. 

678
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,980
 A blessing says, 

679
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,540
 I didn't fit in the sky. 

680
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,520
 I am a believer servant ... 

681
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,280
 I fit into your heart. 

682
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,760
 We will protect our minds, son. 

683
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,880
 We will not engage him in vain. 

684
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,860
 Our mind ... 

685
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,200
 He will always work for good works. 

686
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,300
 Take care of the world ... 

687
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,500
 We will act the entire world. 

688
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:06,000
 While putting a stone on a stone ... 

689
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,940
 Thinking about the sentence realm ... 

690
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,760
 We will not get anyone down. 

691
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,820
 We will not make the world ugly. 

692
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,200
 We will not persecute you. 

693
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,100
 Nature ... 

694
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,620
 We will not turn it into a human dump. 

695
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,380
 We are the ummah of the prophet who is confident. 

696
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,600
 In every position we are in ... 

697
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,180
 We have to make sure. 

698
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,800
 In the head of the family ... 

699
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,260
 In the state duty ... 

700
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,740
 In trade, agriculture ... 

701
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,680
 We will never lose our quality. 

702
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:53,400
 Because if we cannot protect the trust of my Lord ... 

703
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,420
 We will be disgraced ... 

704
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,440
 We lose our scouts. 

705
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:04,980
 Those who claim the entrusted trust will be determined. 

706
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,060
 Resurrection fire ... 

707
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,780
 Those who are confident will spend their time. 

708
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,420
 God... 

709
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,620
 Hand with those who are sure. 

710
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,660
 What do you get? 

711
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,780
 What do you think you are doing? 

712
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,380
 Ertuğrul, do not you get out of my head? 

713
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,740
 Do you delete the foundation that holds the foundation? 

714
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,760
 Selcan Hatun is the order of Dündar Bey. 

715
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,320
 You Nat. 

716
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,720
 All for your masculinity. 

717
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,460
 Saltuk ... 

718
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:19,500
 Your father... 

719
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:22,380
 Didn't he catch up with my Solomon Shah? 

720
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,660
 Didn't your father be martyred while fighting with Ertuğrul Bey? 

721
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,500
 I do not spoil my Ertuğrul Bey's bed. 

722
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,860
 You shouldn't, Selcan Hatun. 

723
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,840
 May you say trouble to gentleman. 

724
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,960
 Is there a gentleman to hear my pain? 

725
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,680
 If I was blind, I wouldn't see them. 

726
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,980
 God, make our end no. 

727
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,480
 Let the thesis reach Cerkutay ... 

728
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,400
 Selcan Hatun leaves the camp. 

729
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,620
 The place he went is obvious. 

730
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,320
 I wish Bala was with me. 

731
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:33,220
 It doesn't stop me to send you to such a head. 

732
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,040
 Don't worry, it won't take long. 

733
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,700
 Let me see Selcan Hatun. 

734
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,500
 Selcan Hatun is the one who knows Osman the best. 

735
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,600
 I would like to get some relief. 

736
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,640
 He will guide me. 

737
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,680
 You still can't look at my face. 

738
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,320
 I misunderstood you, Osman Bey. 

739
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,640
 I never get to it. 

740
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,020
 If you get it wrong, let me say the truth. 

741
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,860
 A person to companion with me ... 

742
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,380
 He should know how to be a tulip when he is deaf. 

743
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
 However, it is difficult for those who doubt. 

744
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,920
 I'm not skeptical, Osman Bey. 

745
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,260
 You cut yourself. 

746
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:42,380
 Obviously this road will be deadlocked. 

747
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,280
 Unable to hear the ear coming out of his mouth ... 

748
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,200
 Whatever I say is empty! 

749
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,880
 I brought the notes of the soldiers on duty, Balgay. 

750
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,080
 Atam Cengiz's ... 

751
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:30,600
 While their happy birthday is being stolen ... 

752
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,680
 These ears ... 

753
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,200
 Didn't he hear anything? 

754
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,020
 Enemy ... 

755
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,800
 The ear that does not hear ... 

756
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
 Unnecessary ear! 

757
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:13,160
 The eye that does not see the enemy ... 

758
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,780
 It is unnecessary eye! 

759
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,360
 In the heart ... 

760
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,620
 The soldier who has no Mongol nobility ... 

761
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,840
 His eyes are blind ... 

762
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,000
 His ear is deaf. 

763
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,960
 Burn them close. 

764
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,660
 From coward and lazy meat ... 

765
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,100
 Wolves, birds ... 

766
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,240
 poisoning. 

767
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,100
 Did they manage to escape? 

768
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:45,620
 No matter which hole he enters, we'll find Osman, Balgay. 

769
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,640
 Not fancy words ... 

770
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,420
 I want blood! 

771
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,360
 Like the Serenge river ... 

772
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:56,060
 I want blood! 

773
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,060
 Commander Balgay ... 

774
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,860
 Samsa, the other lord of the Kayi oba, 

775
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,420
 Osman's corrupt ... 

776
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,740
 Our man in Oba said. 

777
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,800
 An arrow to hunt an eagle ... 

778
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,660
 Again it is made from his feathers. 

779
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:32,420
 A man you ignored ... 

780
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:35,340
 Send it to Samsa's oba. 

781
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,080
 Should they bring it to you? 

782
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,340
 It will come. 

783
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,220
 Now what you need ... 

784
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,900
 It is Samsa's courage. 

785
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,260
 The man you sent ... 

786
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,960
 Let's play with his pride ... 

787
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,520
 May Samsa solve this with blood. 

788
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,400
 How many Mongols I cut ... 

789
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:03,380
 Freedom enthusiasts 

790
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,780
 It will be gathered around. 

791
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,880
 That's when ... 

792
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,300
 With the ambition of Osman ... 

793
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,920
 Samsa's courage will snatch. 

794
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,020
 We ... 

795
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,900
 We Fatigue. 

796
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,260
 Your trust ... 

797
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,060
 I will carry it with my honor. 

798
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
 The Çobanbaş ... 

799
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,120
 If you go too, who will goats goatsher? 

800
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,980
 I am docile to you. 

801
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:25,520
 May my father be on the post of Süleyman Şah ... 

802
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,460
 I will ask you to calculate what they have done, Balgay. 

803
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:05,060
 When Balgay realized that he had lost the dog chest ... 

804
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,780
 He turned to a dog that was angry. 

805
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,560
 Balgay is the enemy brother we know. 

806
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,640
 What about the hypocrites within us? 

807
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,860
 One nation ... 

808
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,520
 Unless it is cleared of the hypocrites inside ... 

809
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,280
 He can never get rid of enemies. 

810
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,940
 Once the spirit of hypocrisy begins to circulate in the veins ... 

811
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,840
 There is no prosperity before that blood is shed. 

812
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,540
 It will come to all of them. 

813
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:43,020
 We will take out your lungs. 

814
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,280
 Sons ... 

815
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,460
 No, I'm Bamsı? 

816
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,260
 I Uthman ... 

817
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,400
 Dündar Balgay's ... 

818
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,240
 He became Sancak Bey. 

819
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,120
 How about you, Bamsı Bey? 

820
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,820
 In return for her obedience, Balgay ... 

821
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,820
 He declared Sancak Bey. 

822
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,320
 Next to our honored flag as his first job in obedience ... 

823
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,840
 The flag of the banner was to hang. 

824
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,520
 You wouldn't do this, Dad! 

825
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,300
 Even the dog Alişar is not so low. 

826
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:49,320
 What about independence? 

827
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,560
 And martyrdom! 

828
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,700
 Not the ones who obey the ikbali ... 

829
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,760
 Defies shields. 

830
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,140
 Don't fall for Ye brothers. 

831
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,420
 First, we will handle the following works. 

832
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,100
 After that, we will crash on the plains. 

833
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:14,360
 We will also tear that flag of banner. 

834
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,560
 Come on, you go, I'll take the chest and come. 

835
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,760
 Salvador... 

836
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:34,340
 Dog... 

837
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:54,380
 He is mine. 

838
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,800
 Mine. 

839
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,320
 I did not betray ... 

840
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:11,860
 I did not betray. 

841
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,200
 Eşedühenlailaheillallah ... 

842
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:27,600
 Abduhu and rasul, which is coveted by coexistence. 

843
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:30,160
 The false hypocrite ... 

844
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,620
 No it is. 

845
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,660
 No time to get rid of my hand. 

846
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,900
 I am Bamsı! 

847
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,720
 You're not. 

848
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,300
 Listen, Bamsı Bey. 

849
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,600
 Mr. Bey took the turn. 

850
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
 Put it, leave Sıddık. 

851
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,800
 I said one more time. 

852
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
 Mr. Sir, what is Sıddık, this is Salvador. 

853
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,060
 Are you okay? 

854
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,780
 I'm fine Osman Bey. 

855
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,980
 The Alps do not know yet. 

856
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,340
 I'm sorry. 

857
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,360
 No matter Osman Bey. 

858
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,440
 What is the situation? 

859
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,480
 Everything goes as you planned. 

860
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,560
 To Sophia Balgay ... 

861
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,580
 He will offer to trap you. 

862
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:06,420
 I Uthman ... 

863
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,060
 Is this Sıddık now? 

864
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,840
 I made a promise to you, Bamsı Bey. 

865
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,180
 I will stick to my word until I die. 

866
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:57,220
 If they install games ... 

867
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:58,940
 We install it too. 

868
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,980
 As long as we do not fall out of the struggle. 

869
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,560
 No longer... 

870
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:12,020
 I see the light of my Ertuğrul Bey in his eyes. 

871
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,280
 That is Mr. ... 

872
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:17,760
 According to the mountain. 

873
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,880
 That is Mr. ... 

874
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,340
 Catch fire after the fog. 

875
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:25,080
 Halal my brave. 

876
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,400
 Good job. 

877
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,320
 Hey, thank you, sir. 

878
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,340
 You're a thousand years, sir. 

879
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,720
 Now I'm going to give the trust. 

880
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:39,320
 Get ready until I come. 

881
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,260
 We will step on the oba. 

882
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:45,740
 Let's go, Osman. 

883
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:31,580
 You didn't know the right time, woman! 

884
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,520
 When Balgay was thirsty for blood ... 

885
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,880
 Take it before you. 

886
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,260
 On the contrary, the supreme commander Balgay ... 

887
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,660
 There is no better time for us to meet. 

888
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:54,180
 I heard that ... 

889
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,840
 Osman took it back. 

890
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:59,100
 Where did you hear? 

891
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:02,020
 You came from a thousand dormitories. 

892
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,500
 We have lived here for a thousand years. 

893
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:14,040
 Do you finally understand why I hate Osman so much? 

894
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:20,340
 He's a rabid dog. 

895
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,600
 A nuisance. 

896
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,640
 If you listen to me ... 

897
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,720
 The path to the hunt will open to you. 

898
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:42,280
 How? 

899
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:47,220
 Osman has someone he trusts enough to entrust his life. 

900
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,560
 And it serves me. 

901
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:01,900
 Sneaky like a marten ... 

902
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,120
 You are cunning like a fox. 

903
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,480
 What do you want in return? 

904
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,900
 You will understand, Balgay. 

905
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:18,700
 We will talk beautifully. 

906
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:55,780
 When you say be ... 

907
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:58,580
 Filling our hearts with the light of faith ... 

908
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,840
 With the 99 names of Allah Almighty. 

909
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,620
 My nation's howls ... 

910
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:07,680
 Gazi gentlemen ... 

911
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,280
 The reputation of beech ... 

912
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:14,280
 It has been destroyed with the ground of Dundar. 

913
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:18,040
 The Mongol judgment of Ertuğrul Bey's office ... 

914
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:20,140
 As if it was not enough with it ... 

915
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:23,480
 He also brought the Mongolian flag and planted it on the apricot. 

916
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:25,860
 Now we have hope. 

917
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,820
 It won't be too long ... 

918
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,400
 Mongolian would haunt our obese. 

919
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,060
 Our number is very low, sir. 

920
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,800
 It takes a miracle to defeat them. 

921
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:39,800
 Do we wait for a war to fight against the name that occupied the Muslim homeland? 

922
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:48,060
 If he can come, he is not cruel, he does not bite us stones. 

923
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,720
 Oba beyond death ... 

924
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:55,500
 Is it finally out of order? 

925
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:58,460
 If death comes once ... 

926
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:59,940
 I ask you ... 

927
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,760
 Why not come for martyrdom? 

928
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,760
 If you came to Cenke ... 

929
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,220
 Samsa, I wouldn't come by gliding like this. 

930
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:28,940
 Development is friendly. 

931
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,160
 We do not have a friendship to be cruel. 

932
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,840
 Our mover upholds our judgment. 

933
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,640
 What did you see for our oban? 

934
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,200
 Why did you come? 

935
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:49,480
 Commander Balgay waits for you. 

936
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:51,200
 What does he want from me? 

937
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,200
 Balgay unwillingly takes it. 

938
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,380
 If you come, it will be in the interest of the oba. 

939
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:07,640
 What if I don't come? 

940
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:12,140
 This time, you cannot save by being a load animal, Samsa. 

941
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:20,780
 We send your head all over the plains in the sense of ibrati alem. 

942
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,440
 Let the news tell the sentence. 

943
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:46,860
 Samsa Bey lit the liberty fire. 

944
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:26,220
 Betrayal... 

945
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,880
 I fulfilled one right of my duty, my father. 

946
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:54,240
 I was always proud of you ... 

947
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,880
 But this time you honored me. 

948
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,200
 Sacrifice your way. 

949
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,540
 Let it be permanent in its principality and Kayı principality. 

950
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:14,300
 May Allah never take you from us. 

951
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,900
 He will soon find out that you are doing this job. 

952
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:29,640
 It will follow. 

953
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,600
 This time I will be wary. 

954
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,780
 His anger burns inside me like ember. 

955
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,000
 Yigit ... 

956
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,320
 You... 

957
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:15,980
 I brought her son. 

958
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:21,100
 Don't ever get involved in my decisions again. 

959
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:29,240
 You are the hope of your beech, Dündar Bey. 

960
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:31,760
 For my child ... 

961
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:35,140
 If I hold my maternity vein and upset you ... 

962
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,140
 Forgive me. 

963
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,280
 May your Sancak Bey be permanent. 

964
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:16,880
 Hayrola sir? 

965
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:20,860
 Betrayal! 

966
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:24,280
 My betrayal is betrayed. 

967
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,780
 Where is Batur? 

968
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:31,440
 My mind said I go and come out. 

969
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,440
 We also have meat in our bud. 

970
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:39,120
 He did not give up the dog. 

971
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:44,860
 Where, sir? 

972
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:48,240
 To take Batur's life. 

973
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:57,800
 Is this how Selcan Hatun? 

974
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:00,360
 I say sacrifice my way ... 

975
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:01,780
 He tells me a secret. 

976
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,480
 Is it a secret to the loving heart? 

977
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,280
 Look, you're silent too. 

978
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:13,780
 There are no more words to say. 

979
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
 If Osman does not trust me. 

980
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:18,280
 Neither does it need my companionship. 

981
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,040
 He already said it to himself. 

982
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,980
 Our path is at a dead end. 

983
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,080
 Our path is at a dead end? 

984
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:31,940
 I know my Osman. 

985
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:33,640
 Obviously angry. 

986
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,100
 No, Selcan Hatun. 

987
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,840
 I thought that Osman's heart burned with love fire. 

988
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:44,720
 I realized that the fire went out. 

989
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:49,000
 Look Bala, my daughter ... 

990
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:52,080
 Being one and being patient to another is another. 

991
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:54,380
 Being patient with each other is another. 

992
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:56,700
 You will learn it. 

993
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:01,660
 The burden of love is one for each person and one for the chick. 

994
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:06,140
 The issue has the heart to bear this burden. 

995
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:09,240
 My Osman's heart is of course with you. 

996
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:12,300
 However, Oguz blood flows in its veins. 

997
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:27,780
 His grandfather and father also had great love ... 

998
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:31,360
 However, he always said honor to the oba. 

999
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:34,200
 So were his girls. 

1000
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,220
 Didn't he ask many things to Solomon Shah? 

1001
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:41,440
 Halime Sultan said okay without knowing the reason for many things. 

1002
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,920
 Bey's dynasty is to know how to keep quiet. 

1003
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:50,340
 Acceptance is. 

1004
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:54,840
 Otherwise, this love will neither help you nor tell him. 

1005
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:58,480
 Then you say you did wrong, Selcan Hatun. 

1006
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:00,960
 I think you broke Osman in vain. 

1007
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,360
 Unless there is a traitor in love, there is no dead end. 

1008
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,280
 Osman was broken maybe. 

1009
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:15,600
 But if you want to take your heart, it's already yours. 

1010
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:21,140
 I thought he wouldn't trust me. 

1011
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:25,220
 Osman's love takes me to the skies. 

1012
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,300
 However, if he turns away, I will fall Selcan Hatun. 

1013
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,260
 Look, Bala, girl. 

1014
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:33,780
 Hold on to this love. 

1015
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:39,000
 Osman will not let you fall without falling. 

1016
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,760
 Do not worry. 

1017
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:54,820
 Her mother sent it to Batur. 

1018
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,720
 My main heart is my daughter. 

1019
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,160
 He worries his son. 

1020
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,440
 Let's be the occasion. 

1021
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:10,360
 Have a nice trip. 

1022
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:12,120
 Thank you, Selcan Hatun. 

1023
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:24,900
 Get ready, we'll watch the girl. 

1024
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,600
 He will take us to Edebalı and Osman. 

1025
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:01,700
 God protect you. 

1026
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:44,540
 Here we will be leaving our way. 

1027
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:47,320
 Whoever is after us take him away. 

1028
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:24,040
 You were afraid of a line and came here. 

1029
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:26,040
 Come on then. 

1030
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:37,180
 No harm will be done. 

1031
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,500
 We had a good load this winter, sir. 

1032
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:09,100
 The people of the people laugh when they go to the market. 

1033
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:12,840
 We deserved, Saltuk. 

1034
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:15,220
 We have faced many trouble. 

1035
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:55,620
 Excuse for romance ... 

1036
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:59,340
 I said that betrayal cannot be compensated for, Batur! 

1037
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:02,040
 You didn't listen to me. 

1038
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:06,060
 I rely on you. 

1039
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:08,400
 I said brother. 

1040
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:11,920
 What did you do ? You sold me. 

1041
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:19,180
 Like you sold Kayı's honor in a snap. 

1042
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:24,520
 Your father ... 

1043
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:26,660
 Surprised by the way of our Ertuğrul Bey ... 

1044
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,380
 As he breaks the ceremony ... 

1045
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:30,860
 You broke me, Batur! 

1046
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:35,880
 You will pay for this! 

1047
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:48,900
 Osman! 

1048
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:00,000
 Osman! 

1049
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:13,580
 Inglourious! 

1050
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:32,420
 Osman! 

1051
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,200
 Batur!

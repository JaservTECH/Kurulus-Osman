1
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,620
 Let go. 

2
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,640
 When Hürriyet goes after the ceng 

3
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,180
 Are you breathless? 

4
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,680
 Osman. 

5
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,860
 Thank you ... 

6
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,400
 Dundar Bey will be my death! 

7
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,340
 What is that? 

8
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,300
 Did you go after what is mine, Osman Osman? 

9
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,740
 No. 

10
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,640
 Cengin Han's happy relics ... 

11
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
 Did you think you'd take it from me? 

12
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,620
 Come on, your hand won't work. 

13
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,440
 Let's! 

14
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,960
 If anything happens to this line, I can't even save you from Balgay's anger. 

15
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
 Okay, Cergukutay. 

16
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,400
 Take it to the malga without shaking the wound of your chick. 

17
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
 Come with me too. 

18
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,340
 We also have unfinished jobs. 

19
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
 Mr. Osman... 

20
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,840
 Mr. Dunday ... 

21
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
 For my father's coat 

22
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,560
 You did business with Mongolian. 

23
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,700
 Your Son's Batur 

24
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,880
 You shared your betrayal. 

25
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,940
 Enough Osman. 

26
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,960
 Enough. 

27
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,180
 Whatever you did ... 

28
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
 ... the misfortune ... 

29
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,600
 ... unknowingly ... 

30
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,440
 ... from your toy. 

31
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
 Kayılar is not the price of what he does ... 

32
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,220
 ... you will pay. 

33
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
 In the rebellion fire you burned ... 

34
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,260
 ... you'll burn alive. 

35
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,420
 My father's quarters ... 

36
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
 ... I'm going to act on your head. 

37
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,440
 Wolves with wolves ... 

38
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,520
 Coyotes with coyotes. 

39
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,400
 The verdict of the jackals ... 

40
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,820
 ... until the wolves stand up. 

41
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,900
 Your death will be my best! 

42
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,460
 This oba ... 

43
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,860
 ... not to Oğuz's ceremony. 

44
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,120
 Genghis Khan's ... 

45
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,880
 is subject to the law. 

46
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,100
 You will not live to pay the price of the betrayal you see ... 

47
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
 Mr. Osman. 

48
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,940
 ... tell me arms. 

49
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 Geber bre Osman! 

50
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
 Either martyrdom ... 

51
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
 ... liberty. 

52
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,060
 Die! 

53
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,760
 Stop! 

54
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,960
 Geber Osman! 

55
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,720
 I came here to buy what belongs to Gayhatu. 

56
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,520
 The laws of Genghis Khan. 

57
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 I managed to take it from Osman's hand. 

58
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,420
 Laws ... 

59
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
 ... is my gift to gay. 

60
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
 The wolf dagger too. 

61
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,660
 The Gayhat ... 

62
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
 ... this victory ... 

63
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 ..will not leave unrequited. 

64
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
 Don't worry, Balgay. 

65
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,860
 Is this Osman? 

66
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,800
 SHE IS. 

67
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,340
 My God. 

68
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,340
 Don't let me down in the hands of the enemy. 

69
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,500
 Allow to be a martyr by shooting. 

70
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,360
 Mr. Osman! 

71
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,060
 He is the prisoner of Gayhatu. 

72
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,320
 No! 

73
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
 Him-her-it... 

74
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,080
 ... we will take it safely to Konya. 

75
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,780
 They Neka. 

76
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
 Take Osman Bey to the car. 

77
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,060
 Cauterize his wound. 

78
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
 Nobody will approach him. 

79
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,400
 Balgay ... 

80
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,680
 .. come to me with me. 

81
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,180
 There is news from Gayhatu. 

82
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,700
 You come too. 

83
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,600
 Osm me. 

84
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,740
 Stop! 

85
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,060
 Stop! 

86
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,500
 You took the banner of Sancak. 

87
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,220
 Commander Balgay .. 

88
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,160
 ... lunch was okay. 

89
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,980
 No work that is not permitted by Gayhatut ... 

90
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,780
 ... is not appropriate. 

91
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,640
 Not that... 

92
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,060
 ... if Balgay saw this appropriate ... 

93
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,780
 ... there is one he knows. 

94
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,880
 On my eyes ... 

95
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,860
 ... My ears ... 

96
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,820
 ... it will be in the obanda. 

97
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,740
 Dündar. 

98
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 Go now. 

99
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,760
 Genghis Khan laws ... 

100
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,980
 ... a person for Konya ... 

101
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,520
 I would like to take it. 

102
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,680
 Finding the laws and ... 

103
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,260
 Gayhatu will know that it is you who gave him. Do not worry. 

104
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,580
 Where did it come to take Osman to Konya? 

105
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,040
 The Gayhat ... 

106
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,320
 ... to learn how he took over the law ... 

107
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,300
 ... wants to question Osman. 

108
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,740
 It's not your job. 

109
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,160
 Is there anything you are afraid of, Balgay? 

110
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,020
 Osman. 

111
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,100
 Osm me. 

112
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
 Osm me. 

113
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,060
 Osm me. 

114
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,400
 Ya Allah! 

115
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,560
 Tobacco. 

116
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,180
 We don't want any problems. 

117
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,160
 Osman will be taken. I am commanded like this. 

118
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,720
 Stop. 

119
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,580
 I'm telling you, Balgay. 

120
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,060
 Or is there anything you are worried about? 

121
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,980
 There is nothing to worry about, Commander Çöni ... 

122
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,640
 The Gayhat ... 

123
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,780
 ... know that I'm ready to die for ... 

124
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,420
 ...sufficient. 

125
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,040
 What if Osman told Gayhatu everything? 

126
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 ...kill. 

127
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
 Osman took the laws and ... 

128
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,340
 ..bring it to me. 

129
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 Buyrug is yours, commander Balgay. 

130
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,520
 Come out! 

131
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,640
 My God ... 

132
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,920
 ... give me strength. 

133
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,280
 Siblings... 

134
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
 Don't fall into the sea, brothers. 

135
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,060
 Hang on, Mr. Hang on. 

136
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
 Stay upright. 

137
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,340
 We will stand upright. 

138
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,340
 We will stand upright Kayı obasi. 

139
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
 Nobody can submit to us. 

140
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,800
 If the sentence world dungeon us ... 

141
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,380
 ... we will never give up on our case. 

142
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
 What about independence? 

143
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,820
 ... martyrdom! 

144
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
 Allahu Akbar! 

145
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,620
 Allahu Akbar! 

146
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,140
 Allahu Akbar! 

147
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,020
 Allahu Akbar! 

148
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
 Allahu Akbar! 

149
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,500
 Allahu Akbar! 

150
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,120
 Allahu Akbar! 

151
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,060
 Allahu Akbar! 

152
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,940
 Mr. Dundar ... 

153
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,320
 Wait for news from me. 

154
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,840
 Non... 

155
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
 our enemies multiply. 

156
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,780
 Do not forget that I gave you Sancak Principality Dundar! 

157
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,640
 My loyalty to you ... 

158
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
 ... is your end, Balgay. 

159
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
 Come out! 

160
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,000
 Where are you? 

161
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Come out, where are you? 

162
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,260
 Batu ... 

163
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,120
 Batu ... 

164
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
 I thought you were a man. 

165
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,720
 But a snake was traveling in your heart. 

166
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,700
 Shame on you, Batur. 

167
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,360
 With this betrayal, you broke the Kayı oba. 

168
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,460
 Mr. Bamsı 

169
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,000
 Abdurrahman Gazi ... 

170
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,420
 Osman put you in his brother's shoes. 

171
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,040
 It passed away for you. 

172
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,360
 The efforts I gave you ... 

173
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,180
 Come on, chick! 

174
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
 Did you think my son was derelict? 

175
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,020
 You make a decision without understanding and listening. 

176
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,600
 Whatever was done I did. 

177
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,520
 I. 

178
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,440
 Your brain did. 

179
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,620
 You do not like ... 

180
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,640
 ... you rebelled ... 

181
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
 ... Your Sancak Brain did. 

182
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,420
 Does your ear hear from your mouth, Dundar? 

183
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,880
 He hears. 

184
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,820
 Hears. 

185
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,480
 Çöm the ... 

186
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,120
 ...here... 

187
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,700
 ... how do you think it came, Bamsı? 

188
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,880
 Who founded this game? 

189
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,860
 So many jackals ... 

190
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
 ... who do you think fled? 

191
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,120
 I. 

192
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,200
 A person. 

193
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,120
 In Konya ... 

194
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,340
 ... I heard the Mongolian governor. 

195
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,480
 It is ... 

196
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,540
 I broke it with ... 

197
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,080
 Now. 

198
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
 The morale of the Balgay dog ​​will deteriorate ... 

199
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,640
 ...and... 

200
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,680
 between them ... 

201
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 ... the fire of power will burn. 

202
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
 In order not to hurt Obama ... 

203
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,900
 I had nothing else to do. 

204
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,840
 If something happens to Osman? 

205
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,400
 What will you do if they take the life of Osman in Konya, Mr. Dundar? 

206
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,980
 They promised. 

207
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,240
 And they drank. 

208
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 They will not harm Osman. 

209
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,460
 They'll just question. 

210
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,340
 They'll just question. 

211
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,880
 We understand. 

212
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,900
 We understand. 

213
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 You are not a traitor. 

214
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,160
 Not that... 

215
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,700
 ... naive. 

216
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,980
 Dündar. 

217
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,240
 Pure! 

218
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,640
 Would there be any trust in Mongolian? 

219
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,520
 Would you trust Mongolian? 

220
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
 Not just Batur. 

221
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,360
 Shame on you too. 

222
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,580
 Shame on you too. 

223
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,080
 If a situation happens to Osman ... 

224
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,880
 ... then he becomes a hawk ... 

225
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,140
 ... I'll break you up with my claws. 

226
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,580
 Here you should know it, Mr. Dundar! 

227
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,180
 You should listen to me well, Sevcan Hatun. 

228
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,160
 In spite of ... 

229
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
 ... there is no former Dundar. 

230
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
 In the slightest mistake ... 

231
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,620
 ... removes his paws ... 

232
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,560
 ... I'll break your wings. 

233
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,840
 You should know it like this. 

234
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,540
 Lets. 

235
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,360
 Lets! 

236
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,060
 no! 

237
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
 Kayı Obası is very fond of you. 

238
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
 Not as much as it is to Cenk with Zalim. 

239
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,020
 But you are very confident that you will come back. 

240
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,720
 Who said Gayhatu will leave you? 

241
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
 Without knowing us ... 

242
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 You came to the end, Çöni. 

243
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
 Migration to our migration ... 

244
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
 ... stretch in our execution ... 

245
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,260
 ... Our revenge ... 

246
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
 ... martyrdom is hidden. 

247
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,940
 Mr. Bamsı. 

248
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,580
 Son is. 

249
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,180
 Where is Balgay it? 

250
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,160
 Who took my Osman ... 

251
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,580
 ... is not Balgay it. 

252
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
 The son of Gayhatu is Çönidir. 

253
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,180
 So Gayhatu also has news of Cengiz Han's mourning. 

254
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 We have already remembered ourselves, huh? 

255
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,500
 It does not matter if he gets up from Cengiz tomb. 

256
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,040
 I will not give my sovereignty to the shrouds. 

257
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,180
 Come on, valiant. 

258
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
 Lets. 

259
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,060
 Osm me. 

260
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,220
 The prisoner is on the run! 

261
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,580
 Get him! 

262
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,380
 Coni ... 

263
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,240
 Is Jangi ... 

264
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
 Kill them all. 

265
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
 Where is Osman? 

266
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,640
 Where is Genghis Khan's law? 

267
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,540
 This account ... 

268
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,280
 ... you will give it to Gayhatu. 

269
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,700
 There is no one to inform Gayhatu Çöni. 

270
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
 You will leave too! 

271
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,460
 You're wrong. 

272
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,380
 Osman... 

273
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,120
 ... will be your end. 

274
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,980
 So you got lost in your horizontal friendship. 

275
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,560
 Find Osman! 

276
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,940
 If you can't find it, I'll dig your liver! 

277
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,360
 Lets! 

278
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
 These are Balgay's men. 

279
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,560
 They killed the Çöni. 

280
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
 Osman Bey is not around. 

281
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,780
 Mr. Bamsı ... 

282
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
 ... this dagger is not yours? 

283
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,920
 Well I'm mine. 

284
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,440
 Where did you find this? 

285
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,780
 There's a dead behind the caravan. 

286
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,220
 I took it from your throat. 

287
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,340
 Good. 

288
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,480
 Good. 

289
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,980
 So, Osman ... 

290
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,320
 Balgay's dog managed to escape before he came. 

291
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,720
 Good. 

292
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,860
 Come on, my lions ... 

293
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
 ... we will find Osman before those jackals. 

294
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,500
 Oops, we will not let Osman sneak, Beyim. 

295
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,260
 Evelallah. 

296
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,100
 Come on valiant, valiant come on. 

297
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,040
 Until he smelled his silk hair ... 

298
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,540
 ... you wrap this yemen on your head. 

299
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
 Every moment I prostrate before Allah Almighty ... 

300
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,920
 ... your fortune is poured on your lips. 

301
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,980
 The truth is ... 

302
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
 ... throughout our life ... 

303
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,520
 ... we always wait for each other. 

304
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,900
 Osman. 

305
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,120
 Forgive. 

306
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,640
 Me. 

307
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,680
 On a narrow day ... 

308
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,660
 I turned you face. 

309
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,080
 Forgive. 

310
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,920
 Pied. 

311
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,260
 Pied. 

312
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,280
 Pied. 

313
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,820
 Pied. 

314
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,840
 Do not be afraid. 

315
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,160
 Eminyett Basin. 

316
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,380
 Who are you? 

317
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
 Never mind who I am. 

318
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,420
 You have to clean your wound and brand it. 

319
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
 You have to hang on. 

320
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,860
 Bala. 

321
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,440
 Bala where are you? 

322
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,440
 Bala where are you? 

323
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,260
 Where are you? 

324
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,180
 Where are you? 

325
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,940
 I'm going to BIL. 

326
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,360
 Where is my honey? 

327
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,340
 Where is my honey? 

328
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,780
 Where? 

329
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,040
 There are two guests in my house, which has no trail. 

330
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,060
 Who are you? 

331
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,560
 Still. 

332
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,200
 I'm looking for someone. 

333
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,760
 His horse is in front of the cave. 

334
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,420
 Osman! 

335
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,780
 Osman. 

336
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,260
 Balam. 

337
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,160
 Osman. 

338
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,180
 What did they do to you? 

339
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,920
 Say it to Cabbar. 

340
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,660
 What did they do to you? 

341
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,900
 Bala. 

342
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
 Tell me who did this to you? 

343
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,280
 What did they do to you? 

344
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,300
 I have nothing. 

345
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,280
 Who did this? 

346
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,720
 lest. 

347
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
 You say, I will shake your heart. 

348
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,280
 Cergutay. 

349
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
 They cut my way. 

350
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,460
 Son. 

351
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,240
 Get out. 

352
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,080
 Son. 

353
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,220
 Don't let the fire go away. 

354
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,520
 You will live, Bala. 

355
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,180
 Will you say he will live? 

356
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,880
 I do not know. 

357
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,700
 I did my best. 

358
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,680
 Appreciate God. 

359
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,840
 You're not good. 

360
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,940
 Lie down late. 

361
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,280
 Cruel dogs. 

362
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,220
 I will make you the worst of deaths. 

363
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,400
 Still. 

364
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
 He is the eye of my eye. 

365
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 Don't let it go. 

366
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,000
 Save him. 

367
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,280
 Save. 

368
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,700
 God help you this servant. 

369
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,540
 I Bismillahirahmanirrah. 

370
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,080
 Assalamu alaikum and mercy 

371
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
 Assalamu alaikum and mercy 

372
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,480
 O Allah, the owner of the property. 

373
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,480
 You dominate everything. 

374
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,840
 You are able. 

375
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,280
 You have real power and might. 

376
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,220
 My God. 

377
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,520
 His ummah is perplexed. 

378
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,980
 It's not just invaders and oppressors. 

379
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,780
 Fitna and discord also captured hearts. 

380
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,340
 Connecting us ... 

381
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
 ... the strongest bond. 

382
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,540
 The believer has forgotten his brotherhood. 

383
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,500
 We lost our faith in each other. 

384
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
 To our enthusiasm and enthusiasm ... 

385
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,420
 ... we succumbed to our ego. 

386
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,760
 O my Lord who knows everything. 

387
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
 The dirt of our heart ... 

388
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,180
 ... wash with the light of Islam. 

389
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,640
 Enlighten us. 

390
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,280
 Forgive us. 

391
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,860
 Swearing ... 

392
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,480
 ... against the cruel and the devil's games ... 

393
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,160
 ... just be alive and alert. 

394
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
 My God. 

395
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,120
 Make us shit and go to those who go to us. 

396
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,760
 Of those who do not return from the right way ... 

397
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
 ... died for this purpose ... 

398
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,900
 ... from those who died. 

399
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,900
 My God. 

400
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,400
 To the honor of the name of El fettah ... 

401
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 distribute our darkness. 

402
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,600
 Make us officer to curse swearing. 

403
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,580
 To us... 

404
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,460
 ... to the believers waiting for hope ... 

405
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,860
 ... to the strange awaiting the gospel ... 

406
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,660
 ... with a new establishment. 

407
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
 Hello, Pirim. 

408
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,100
 I Aleykümselam. 

409
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,260
 No, Bamsı Bey. 

410
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,200
 Pirin. 

411
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,160
 To take my Ottoman ... 

412
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,280
 Gayhatu's men came from Konya. 

413
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
 Osman got rid of his hands, but ... 

414
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,340
 now we can't find it. 

415
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,280
 As if the oil was pierced ... 

416
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,760
 ... Osman came into it. 

417
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,460
 I Bismillahirrahmanirah. 

418
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,220
 Bala Hatun is also missing. 

419
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,560
 We are looking for him everywhere. 

420
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,560
 Shouldn't it be a job? 

421
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
 They shouldn't have fallen into the hands of Mongolian again, Pirim? 

422
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,100
 Yusuf from the well ... 

423
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,280
 ... Abraham from fire ... 

424
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,380
 ... that makes Ismail since the knife ... 

425
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,780
 ... both faith ... 

426
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
 ... is also effort, Bamsı Bey. 

427
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,340
 It is not time to stop. 

428
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,060
 Let's go search. 

429
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,120
 Takbir from us. 

430
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,880
 Appreciate Allah. 

431
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,760
 Thank you Pirim, come on. 

432
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,260
 Come on, lions. 

433
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,300
 Lets. 

434
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,680
 Where are you, Balaam? 

435
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,840
 Where are you? 

436
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,260
 What happened here Gonca Hatun? 

437
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,040
 Pehlivan Derviş battling. 

438
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,300
 Blood everywhere. 

439
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,660
 I found the bundle nearby. 

440
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,100
 Someone has things in it. 

441
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,460
 However, there is no news from the Bala Line. 

442
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,280
 Bala. 

443
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,680
 These ornaments ... 

444
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,320
 ... these are from Bala's title. 

445
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,180
 Yarenler ... 

446
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,400
 ... keep searching around you. 

447
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,900
 I will go to Kayı oba. 

448
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,300
 I have to find Selcan Hatunu. 

449
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:26,960
 OK. 

450
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,980
 May God be with you. 

451
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,340
 You also be entrusted to Allah. 

452
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,140
 My nation's howls ... 

453
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,100
 Çetin Alp will take you to a safe place. 

454
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,260
 We will go up to the mountains and light the rebellion fire. 

455
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,140
 Until we dismantle the Mongolian Cereat, which is destined to our soil ... 

456
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,980
 ... has no comfortable face for us. 

457
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,460
 There is no one looking for a comfortable face, Samsa Bey. 

458
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,040
 Don't look at our age. 

459
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,000
 In a nara, we have gayz to break 9 armies. 

460
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,820
 You took your turn of martyrdom, Sazak Bey. 

461
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
 Now it's our turn to crash. 

462
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
 May Allah not give death asleep. 

463
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,500
 Amine. 

464
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,020
 Gentlemen ... 

465
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,440
 Canoes and chicks first entrusted to God and then to you Çetin Alp. 

466
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,980
 Thank you, Mr.. 

467
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,160
 My gentlemen, standing next to me like mountains ... 

468
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,560
 ... if you have the right to be lawful to you. 

469
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,700
 You are also halal. 

470
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,060
 Halal, sir. 

471
00:55:54,020 --> 00:56:02,640
 Long live Samsa Beyim. 

472
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,380
 The wrath of the dark souls ... 

473
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,240
 ... Cerkutay bre. 

474
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,560
 How do you miss a wounded chick? 

475
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,300
 What a fool. 

476
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,740
 You will pay for this. 

477
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,100
 Did you handle it? 

478
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,580
 Commander Balgay ... 

479
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,100
 I killed the soldiers. 

480
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,160
 They are no longer a threat to us. 

481
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,320
 Beautiful. 

482
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,740
 What about Osman? 

483
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,860
 What about Genghis Khan's laws? 

484
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,940
 When I went to them, Osman had already fled. 

485
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,660
 Commander Balgay ... 

486
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,760
 Osman Cengiz Khan also took the laws and escaped. 

487
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,400
 I sent the soldiers after him. 

488
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,720
 Osman is injured and alone. 

489
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,300
 We'll find him sooner or later, Commander Balgay. 

490
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:26,040
 Send the soldiers Osman will kill the Alps. 

491
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,240
 Send a thesis to Konya. 

492
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,840
 Describe what happened as I wanted. 

493
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,200
 This is yours, Balgay. 

494
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,980
 In the name of the wrath of the souls ... 

495
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,480
 Call me Zühre. 

496
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,980
 Secretly come to me tomorrow. 

497
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,940
 Don't let himself open to Dündar. 

498
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,460
 Gayhatu to ... 

499
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,220
 Genghis Khan's trust ... 

500
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,860
 Who said you had me? 

501
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,760
 I will learn from him. 

502
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,000
 Lets! 

503
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,260
 What are you waiting for, come on bre! 

504
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,480
 So Samsa retreats to the mountains ... 

505
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,880
 ... rebelled against Balgay? 

506
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,720
 He took his father's wives and children to a safe place. 

507
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,020
 Tomorrow ... 

508
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,500
 He would retreat to the Sahin Hill with the Alps. 

509
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,820
 Are they brave enough to fight Balgay with a handful of Apli? 

510
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,680
 Stupid enough to think he will win this war. 

511
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,880
 With Balgay's station ... 

512
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,720
 poor enough to deserve to die. 

513
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,320
 Balgay tomorrow ... 

514
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,220
 How did he know that Samsa would go to Şahin Hill? 

515
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,060
 There is only one answer to this, master Yannis. 

516
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,200
 One of Balgay Samsay's Gentlemen ... 

517
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,760
 ... must have bought someone. 

518
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,800
 Our ... 

519
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,580
 ... among the residents of Balgay ... 

520
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,580
 we had to get a spy. 

521
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,000
 That's why ... 

522
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,960
 ... I will do what is necessary, Sofia. 

523
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,840
 Who do you have in mind? 

524
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,800
 Everyone in this world has a price. 

525
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,260
 Or a weakness. 

526
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,360
 Master Yannis. 

527
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,700
 Osman Bey escaped from Gayhatu's soldiers, Salvador. 

528
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,900
 Somehow I'm not surprised. 

529
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,800
 Osman... 

530
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,440
 like oil. 

531
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,300
 Nobody can hold it. 

532
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,900
 To overcome Osman's right ... 

533
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,020
 ... there is no other benefit than to detach his sinister head from his body. 

534
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,580
 Its also ... 

535
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,820
 ... to take us to the place where the Alps are hiding ... 

536
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,620
 it's time for Salvador. 

537
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,760
 When we raid ... 

538
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,980
 Make sure Osman is there. 

539
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,300
 I will be the head of the soldiers. 

540
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,920
 I will be with you ... 

541
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,660
 ...Princess Sofia. 

542
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,740
 My stout warrior is Salvador. 

543
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,500
 Go now... 

544
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,400
 ... start preparations. 

545
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,900
 You will take Osman, Sofia. 

546
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,340
 Genghis Khan's ... 

547
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,760
 ... laws ... 

548
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,060
 ...You will take it. 

549
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:34,680
 Balgay ... 

550
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,360
 should not come to the raid. 

551
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,780
 Are you getting me? 

552
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,180
 Don't worry, master Yannis. 

553
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,000
 Selcan Hatun! 

554
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,280
 I hope it is good. 

555
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,300
 Bala. 

556
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,520
 No Bala. 

557
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,680
 What do you mean? 

558
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,720
 He said he was going to meet you ... 

559
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,680
 I said I'll come too. 

560
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,500
 I said I wouldn't mind to send you to such a head. 

561
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,780
 I did not listen. 

562
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,640
 Gone. 

563
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,900
 Period. 

564
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,780
 Dervishes search everywhere. 

565
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,580
 Nobody knows. 

566
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,700
 The moon happened to us. 

567
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,040
 No sign of a sign? 

568
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,380
 We found a bundle. 

569
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,700
 But the contents are not Bala's. 

570
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,580
 Men's clothes. 

571
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,760
 Venus... 

572
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,200
 Where we found the bundle ... 

573
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,360
 ... there are traces of blood. 

574
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,120
 Obviously there was a strike. 

575
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,300
 We also found silver ornaments on Bala's head. 

576
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,160
 Selcan Hatun. 

577
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,840
 Let us say to my victim, Osman Bey. 

578
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,820
 No one else can find Bala. 

579
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,120
 Osman. 

580
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,800
 Osm me. 

581
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,240
 Osman. 

582
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,620
 Bala. 

583
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,000
 He won't hear you. 

584
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,420
 It is in another realm. 

585
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,600
 Come on inside. 

586
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,080
 You have to gather strength. 

587
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,380
 This is not enough for you. 

588
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:34,880
 Stop. 

589
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,460
 It would be a piece of dried meat. 

590
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,980
 Will he still live? 

591
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,640
 It will be okay, right? 

592
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,600
 Hey, it's black love. 

593
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,100
 You think you're back from death yourself. 

594
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,180
 I hope it will be alive! 

595
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,700
 If he goes ... 

596
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,880
 ... my dear half goes. 

597
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,560
 At that time... 

598
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,340
 ... if I put the sentence world on fire ... 

599
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:29,000
 I don't get angry with those who do it. 

600
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,640
 Your heart is cavity as well as your wish. 

601
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,500
 Such love must be such a heart. 

602
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,340
 Say, well. 

603
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,540
 Who are you, Osman Bey? 

604
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,160
 from Kayi. 

605
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,540
 How do you know my name? 

606
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,560
 Osman recalled Osman. 

607
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,880
 You are certain. 

608
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,340
 Who are you? 

609
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,040
 You by whom? 

610
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,040
 They say Elif Hatun. 

611
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,760
 There is no one who says his name, who has nobody. 

612
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,700
 Why do you live in this cave? 

613
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,580
 It must be difficult alone. 

614
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,100
 I don't like people. 

615
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,660
 Serving the servant ... 

616
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 ... I never like to hope for medet. 

617
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,240
 I have run away there for years. 

618
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,900
 There is no one. 

619
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,820
 There is peace. 

620
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,420
 Not one, but two. 

621
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,700
 He's injured. 

622
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,740
 We missed your peace, Elif Mum. 

623
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,260
 God bless you. 

624
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,220
 You healed us too. 

625
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,020
 You'll be fine. 

626
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,340
 This nook remains to me anyway. 

627
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,700
 The erect shield from the heavy wound ... 

628
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,640
 ... is brave. 

629
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,720
 Hullo. 

630
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,620
 You're very solid. 

631
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,420
 I've lost a lot of blood. 

632
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,980
 I must gain strength. 

633
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,080
 I must stand up, mom. 

634
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,880
 The enemy is many. 

635
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,700
 It is also tough. 

636
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,060
 It's good enough. 

637
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,220
 Get in front of my eyes. 

638
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,620
 Cenk does not scare me, evelallah. 

639
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,780
 There is still no news from Osman, right? 

640
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,580
 None, my father, but don't worry. 

641
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
 The Alps are always on duty. 

642
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,540
 He can't come near the bed. 

643
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,360
 Batur! 

644
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,680
 You will not take the precaution again. 

645
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,920
 This is Osman ... 

646
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,700
 ... it is not clear what it will do. 

647
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,660
 Emmi. 

648
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,320
 What do you think you're doing? 

649
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,440
 How do you let Osman be taken away? 

650
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,760
 These... 

651
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,060
 These are my father's principal signs. 

652
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,680
 With what right do you carry it in your room? 

653
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,840
 What are you trying to do? 

654
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,780
 These are not Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

655
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,140
 ... belongs to Kayı Bey. 

656
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:37,920
 So? 

657
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:40,440
 Did my father fly, so you get them then? 

658
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,020
 Since you are with Nike ... 

659
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,360
 ... you don't know about the situation. 

660
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,560
 Mr. Gayri ... 

661
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,300
 ... do not exceed your limits. 

662
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,880
 Come on, raspberry ... 

663
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,680
 ... determines honor. 

664
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,180
 Mr. Dundar. 

665
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 Is it the goods sold in the new market? 

666
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,760
 You give and take according to your head? 

667
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,280
 The master rules. 

668
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,240
 Alp makes the head. 

669
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,340
 Pay attention to the word that comes out of his mouth Gündüz Bey. 

670
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,000
 We will not document the ceremony from new orphans. 

671
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,220
 You don't make me my nephew. 

672
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,900
 Get out of my room. 

673
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,000
 Get out! 

674
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,280
 Day. 

675
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,620
 Dellen Maya. 

676
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,340
 Come by day. 

677
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,880
 Bu ... 

678
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,640
 ... I will not see you again in this place. 

679
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,980
 Our job with informal here ... 

680
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,620
 ... it is over. 

681
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,060
 Cenk wait. 

682
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,940
 You need to heal more. 

683
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,120
 Cenk doesn't stop at the enemy, mom. 

684
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,460
 Cocks watch the moment to shoot. 

685
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,520
 Get my sword ready. 

686
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,940
 I won't stop either. 

687
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,100
 I rebelled. 

688
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,360
 Osman. 

689
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,140
 Bala. 

690
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,660
 Bala. 

691
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,780
 Thank goodness to my Lord. 

692
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,640
 Look at me. 

693
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,100
 Look, let me have a feast. 

694
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,740
 Go get some wood. 

695
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,060
 He shouldn't be cold. 

696
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,500
 I put the big mountain on fire. 

697
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,520
 As long as you are cold. 

698
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,240
 You'll be fine, Bala. 

699
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,840
 You will be fine. 

700
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,940
 All that will pass. 

701
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,420
 Elif mother is here. 

702
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,980
 I go and come. 

703
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,020
 Get up like this. 

704
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,440
 Thank God your eyes are opened. 

705
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,100
 Inner. 

706
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,260
 It is healing. 

707
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,600
 Something pass through your crop. 

708
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,600
 Thank you, mom. 

709
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,340
 The pain spreads to my legs. 

710
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
 As if it got numb. 

711
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,280
 Not a marash, right? 

712
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,820
 I hope nothing will stay on your legs. 

713
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,040
 Where does he stay? 

714
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,880
 lest. 

715
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,940
 I do not want another. 

716
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,100
 You do not say. 

717
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,580
 Tell me, what's the mother you're hiding? 

718
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,660
 I did everything I could. 

719
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,880
 God also allowed his life. 

720
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,760
 Not that... 

721
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,280
 ... the wound is in a bad place. 

722
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,720
 Some scars remain on the meat ... 

723
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,780
 ... some of them go to the soul. 

724
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,200
 Yours in soul-manipulating genus. 

725
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,480
 Look girl. 

726
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:26,600
 If you ask why in this realm, you cannot reach its essence. 

727
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,680
 Doors... 

728
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,840
 ... is only open to those who settle. 

729
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,620
 What do you mean mom? 

730
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,740
 Tell straight ahead. 

731
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,060
 You're a certain cengaver girl. 

732
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,280
 So your destiny doesn't have a baby gushing. 

733
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
 How? 

734
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,700
 Grant. 

735
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,260
 I don't know if this job comes from here. 

736
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,840
 Allah owns miracles. 

737
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:17,300
 If our Sare valid became a mother at the age of 90 ... 

738
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,840
 ... a baby whose womb has been shattered may also have a son. 

739
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:24,980
 God knows. 

740
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,040
 What are you saying mom? 

741
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,720
 What are you saying? 

742
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,460
 I'll blow the fire. 

743
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,740
 I'll make it warm here. 

744
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,060
 Me... 

745
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,420
 ..dark... 

746
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,180
 take it to the souls. 

747
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,680
 Shoman shaman drum. 

748
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:54,600
 Let dark souls hear my oath. 

749
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:05,000
 May the law take my soul from black mud to black iron. 

750
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,560
 My oath is for Erlik Han. 

751
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:17,320
 Erlik Han is Balgay's oath to you. 

752
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:22,600
 I will water the palace of the Turk, called Osman, with his blood. 

753
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:31,660
 Settle your flesh to the ravens, I will put your soul into you. 

754
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:36,120
 Reaching you with Balgay's shorty drum ... 

755
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,840
 ... listen to your voice. 

756
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,280
 Usman ... 

757
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,540
 ... come across me. 

758
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,700
 If I don't stop in my oath ... 

759
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,960
 ... what black places ... 

760
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:11,580
 ... what blue skies will take my soul. 

761
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:19,240
 In pain ... 

762
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
 ...forever... 

763
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:28,160
 ... wretched soul. 

764
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,640
 Erlik Han. 

765
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,560
 To me... 

766
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:41,120
 Give Osman. 

767
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
 Elif mother is the weird chick. 

768
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,840
 Not if I say reverse ... 

769
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,900
 ... not if I say nemrut. 

770
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,880
 However, his hand is healing. 

771
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,000
 ... it doesn't stop any more. 

772
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,540
 He will make you a porridge. 

773
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,420
 Let your face smile now. 

774
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,900
 All passed and gone. 

775
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:06,260
 We have a lot of trouble and enemies. 

776
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,980
 We have no other purpose but to hold on to each other, Bala Hatun. 

777
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,600
 I'm in trouble with us all the trouble. 

778
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,540
 After that, I came across my city. 

779
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,540
 I will want you once again. 

780
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,340
 We will have a big toy. 

781
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
 We will have tall children. 

782
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,000
 We will multiply. 

783
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,400
 We will multiply ... 

784
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,460
 ... I kudretlenel. 

785
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,060
 Especially get a level .. 

786
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,340
 ... is beyond grant, Osman. 

787
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,040
 There are hard struggles in your destiny. 

788
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,600
 But you will be stronger with your children. 

789
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,280
 Everyone will hear Osman's sons ... 

790
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,320
 ... he will know. 

791
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,920
 You will forget these pains. 

792
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,100
 Even those who love you ... 

793
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,020
 ... he will have a heart like you. 

794
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,840
 May Allah be decorated with victories. 

795
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,880
 No, Bala Hatun. 

796
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,120
 You speak like you will leave. 

797
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,820
 I pray that our voyage is one and together. 

798
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,240
 Why do you say that? 

799
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,620
 I... 

800
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,920
 I will give my dear if it is necessary for you, Osman. 

801
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,500
 Besides Elbet ... 

802
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,740
 ... I'll be in your area. 

803
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,320
 Kismet. 

804
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,320
 You have pain. 

805
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:49,160
 I know your eyes will laugh once you get better. 

806
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,620
 All that will pass. 

807
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,180
 It will pass. 

808
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,480
 These tough days will be left behind. 

809
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,740
 I hope my Lord ... 

810
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,260
 ... those girls ... 

811
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,320
 ... grant the sons. 

812
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,380
 Let me know their father ... 

813
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,220
 ...I wish... 

814
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,680
 ... be their mother. 

815
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,120
 I hope it will happen. 

816
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,820
 God willing. 

817
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:17,860
 Amine. 

818
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,460
 Don't think of me, Osman. 

819
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,500
 Kul establishes ... 

820
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,540
 ... they say fate laughs. 

821
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,300
 Allah is great. 

822
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,760
 I hope you give it according to your heart. 

823
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:40,080
 I understood, I understood. 

824
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,920
 When you are sick, you will be spoiled. 

825
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,940
 get. 

826
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,060
 Coming from you is nice to me. 

827
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,080
 Elif mother. 

828
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,100
 Bala Hatun is entrusted to you. 

829
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,400
 Bring him to his father. 

830
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,560
 Who is his father, where will I find him? 

831
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,200
 Bala Hatun will show you the way. 

832
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,220
 Sheik is Literary. 

833
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,960
 Is Sheikh Literary? 

834
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,780
 It means that Allah will give me the prayer of the good servant. 

835
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,160
 My Sheikh. 

836
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,940
 You've been up all night. Tired. 

837
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,060
 Of course, they will find both Osman and Bala Hatun. 

838
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,480
 If you order some rest? 

839
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,980
 Our Lord is greater than our troubles, my minds. 

840
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,380
 Amenna. 

841
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,300
 Of course, he is the owner of the discretion. 

842
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,640
 Isn't it lunch, Gonca girl? 

843
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,940
 As you say, Sheikh. 

844
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
 My Lord is greater than our troubles. 

845
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,420
 Not that... 

846
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,080
 ... I was helpless. 

847
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,140
 My mind is Bala. 

848
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,420
 Our minds ... 

849
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,880
 ... our mind ... 

850
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,100
 ... our hearts ... 

851
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,160
 ... is always in Bala. 

852
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,060
 But if there is a test, 

853
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,180
 There is surely help. 

854
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,140
 Keep your heart fresh. 

855
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,000
 Bala. 

856
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,020
 Bala girl ... 

857
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,060
 Oh thank god my dear. Come. 

858
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,540
 Come Bala. 

859
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,220
 Be injured, cautious. 

860
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,020
 Slow. 

861
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,340
 Come on girl. 

862
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:11,760
 Come. 

863
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,720
 Slow. 

864
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,860
 I Bismillahirahmanirah. 

865
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,580
 Oh thank God my dear. 

866
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,920
 Thank goodness to my Lord. 

867
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,900
 God bless you, Hatun. 

868
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,560
 You brought me to my daughter. 

869
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,340
 May Allah grant the wish of your heart. 

870
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,740
 Beyond the good prayer of a blessed man like you ... 

871
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,740
 .. I don't want Sheikh Literature. 

872
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,400
 I also brought Osman Bey's greetings. 

873
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,740
 It is brave and valiant. 

874
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,160
 It is. 

875
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,220
 Sit down. 

876
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,100
 Gasp. 

877
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,860
 Tell me. 

878
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,400
 What is Osman Bey's past? 

879
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,800
 Get up. 

880
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:06,920
 You... 

881
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,160
 Osman and Edebalı ... 

882
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,420
 I said where to find it. 

883
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,680
 My words were correct. 

884
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,300
 I want more from you. 

885
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,960
 I kept my word. 

886
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,560
 My son is informally under your protection. 

887
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,440
 What more do you want? 

888
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,940
 Shut up, cut off. 

889
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
 In the ear of Gayhatu ... 

890
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,840
 Who whispered that I had the laws of Genghis Khan ... 

891
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,520
 ...who? 

892
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,500
 I do not know. 

893
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,300
 Cerkutay ... 

894
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,320
 ... go to thesis ... 

895
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:12,260
 ... bring Batur, son of this god, bre. 

896
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:19,220
 I will cradle his mother and shake his mother and make him pay for his son. 

897
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,080
 No, stop. 

898
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,900
 Wait. 

899
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,660
 Talk. 

900
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,440
 Talk. 

901
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,000
 Who? 

902
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,240
 Gayhatu to ... 

903
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:40,040
 Who said I have the laws of Genghis Khan? 

904
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,360
 Who? 

905
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,400
 I'm asking you for the last time. 

906
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,200
 Either you tell me your ragged horny push name. 

907
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,780
 Or he gives Batur's head to his lap, 

908
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,080
 I'll bury you alive. 

909
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,100
 Who? 

910
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,140
 These are the signs of my father's principality. 

911
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,820
 ... with what right do you carry it in your room? 

912
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,540
 These are not Ertuğrul Gazi ... 

913
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,780
 ... is a cry to Kayı Bey. 

914
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,760
 My dad was flying so that you would get them then? 

915
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,760
 Since most Nikela ... 

916
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,500
 ... you don't know about the situation. 

917
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,440
 Day. 

918
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,880
 Osman's older brother Gündüz? 

919
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,600
 Yes he is. 

920
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,460
 Two days ago ... 

921
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,700
 ... he left the camp. 

922
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:39,660
 We knew he went to Nikea. 

923
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,900
 But he went to Konya. 

924
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,140
 With Commander Çöni ... 

925
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,900
 ... bringing his soldiers to the camp ... 

926
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,140
 ... it was. 

927
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:01,420
 I told you. 

928
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,280
 What more do you want from me? 

929
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,240
 O Osman ... 

930
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,700
 I don't know Osman. 

931
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,500
 Who is there with Osman? 

932
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:23,880
 Samsa Bey and Bamsı Bey are close to Osman. 

933
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,900
 Osman is with them. 

934
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,480
 Samsa Osman with a bloody knife. 

935
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,300
 How would you be? 

936
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,660
 They know to be the only fist against the enemy. 

937
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,200
 If you find Samsa ... 

938
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,120
 You'll find Osman too, Balgay. 

939
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,880
 I know where Samsa is. 

940
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,760
 Cankutay. 

941
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,960
 Tell Kongur to get the carrion of them all with the best soldiers. 

942
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:17,380
 With the law of Genghis Khan, I want Osman to survive. 

943
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,940
 Bring them to Kuluç fortress. 

944
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,380
 What are you still waiting for, bre avrat? 

945
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,700
 Get out! 

946
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,400
 There are those who come. 

947
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,100
 Is there a boran sign? 

948
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,280
 There is no Beyim None. 

949
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:33,820
 Evlet on ... 

950
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,300
 ... sons. 

951
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,640
 How... 

952
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,540
 My Osman did not surrender to the tafaurata in Konya. 

953
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,220
 We will not surrender to the ministry. 

954
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:48,120
 We will do whatever it takes to save my Ottoman. 

955
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:48,900
 Hehe. 

956
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:44,820
 Osm me. 

957
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,920
 Finally. 

958
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:56,960
 My Lord, thank you. 

959
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,400
 Osm me. 

960
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,920
 O Lord, thank you. 

961
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,820
 Thank God. 

962
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:05,160
 Hallelujah. 

963
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:12,820
 Aslan. 

964
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,260
 Hullo. 

965
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,460
 Hullo. 

966
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,720
 Are you okay? 

967
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,400
 We are good. 

968
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,320
 Are you okay? 

969
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,780
 I knew they couldn't do anything to you. I knew. 

970
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,460
 Oh, Come on. 

971
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,480
 Mr. Bamsı. 

972
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:20,740
 Are you okay? 

973
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,380
 Thanks to Bamsı Bey. 

974
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,580
 Thanks to you. 

975
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:29,600
 Osm me. 

976
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,700
 Abdurrahman Gazi. 

977
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,960
 Osm me. 

978
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,640
 Osm me. 

979
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,060
 Abdurrahman Gazi. 

980
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,060
 What about the plain? 

981
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,480
 Konya news that ... 

982
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,320
 Dundar Beymis. 

983
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,180
 Emmim sold his soul to the Mongolian dog. 

984
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:19,820
 My mind is to save my life ... 

985
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,340
 ... cooperates with Gayhatu. 

986
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,320
 So the news that goes to Konya is not for you, Bey. 

987
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,800
 He calculated to open the gap between Balgay and Gayhatu. 

988
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
 According to her, ... 

989
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,840
 ... miskinlikl to ... 

990
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,460
 ...calculate... 

991
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,260
 ... there is no accident with a lie. 

992
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,420
 Here is the enemy ... 

993
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,700
 ... challenge. 

994
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,020
 Emmim drank a lot of Byzantine water. 

995
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,220
 If you can't crash like Alp. 

996
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,320
 As Eren, you will know to stand aside. 

997
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,900
 You are thoughtful, Bamsı Bey. 

998
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,440
 No, no. 

999
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:07,880
 Osm me. 

1000
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:10,660
 Samsa with a Mongolian commander ... 

1001
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:12,280
 ... cut his two soldiers. 

1002
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,600
 I am thinking about her. 

1003
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,280
 Then Balgay ... 

1004
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,640
 Samsa will have Sufism. 

1005
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,960
 Bey, Mr. Samsa evacuated his oba. 

1006
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:40,840
 Withdraw to the mountains with the Alps attached to it. 

1007
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:44,180
 Hello, 

1008
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,580
 Hello, hello 

1009
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,400
 Sofia ... 

1010
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:50,740
 Osman Bey knows that Samsa Brain is on Sahin Hill. 

1011
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,920
 It will also provoke Sofia Balgay. 

1012
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,220
 Samsa Bey is in danger. 

1013
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,220
 We need to come and save a thesis. 

1014
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,740
 We are going to set them up with such a real trap ... 

1015
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,980
 ... we will shoot 1 stone and 2 birds. 

1016
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,300
 Both Balgay ... 

1017
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,400
 both Sofia. 

1018
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:19,900
 Bey. 

1019
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,580
 Sofia is the great snake. 

1020
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,480
 Will it come to the game? 

1021
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,920
 Now it is incurred. 

1022
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:34,940
 Siddiq. 

1023
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,220
 He will be Salvador and tell Sheikh Edabali's location. 

1024
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,300
 This food can not stand. 

1025
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:52,940
 Bey. 

1026
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,460
 Did you leave the women with the ladies? 

1027
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,000
 The Alps are interested, Beyim. 

1028
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,680
 They will arrive on arrival not in the morning. 

1029
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,020
 Why aren't you at the beginning? 

1030
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,080
 Bey. 

1031
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,440
 If you confiscate, you can keep your wars 

1032
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,480
 ... I want to be a city. 

1033
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,500
 The martyrs' hill is full, my dear. 

1034
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,320
 It is not idle, insha'Allah. 

1035
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,940
 But you need me alive. 

1036
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,560
 Stay right ... 

1037
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,860
 ... wherever there is persecution, let's shake pusat back to back. 

1038
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,580
 In the Istiklal fire we burned, the sentence oppressed will warm up. 

1039
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,240
 Nice cruelty will burn. 

1040
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:33,540
 We will take life and die until the hope of the Turkish nation's justice is exhausted. 

1041
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:40,360
 But while the life is alive, we will not give a dormitory. 

1042
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,220
 Hard-faced, hard-eyed. They cut the shroud to the Turk. 

1043
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,720
 But there is something they forgot. 

1044
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,240
 If evil does not end in the realm ... 

1045
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,140
 ... it doesn't end in Turkish. 

1046
01:41:53,140 --> 01:42:03,480
 Is Allahuekber. 

1047
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,960
 Zöhre Hatun! 

1048
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,640
 Come on. 

1049
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,400
 Sit down. 

1050
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,920
 Let's say two words. 

1051
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,360
 I gave myself to work. 

1052
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,280
 I'll keep you entertained. 

1053
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,600
 But my heart hits like a bird. 

1054
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,200
 Trouble on trouble. 

1055
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,980
 What are you doing? 

1056
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,140
 Where are you coming from? 

1057
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,640
 My device is a little cold. 

1058
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:09,620
 I said I should collect mint, I couldn't find them. 

1059
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,940
 There was also linden. 

1060
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:14,180
 I said I boil, I'm back. 

1061
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,180
 God heal my daughter. 

1062
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,440
 Thanks. 

1063
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,940
 What do you say to the stool, Zöhre? 

1064
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,300
 You know the inside of the job better. 

1065
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:32,360
 You can understand what is on your mind without saying Dundar Bey. 

1066
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:40,360
 God knows our end, Selcan Hatun. 

1067
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,480
 Dundar Bey's business is not mindful. 

1068
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,280
 Separated with Moğul ... 

1069
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:48,520
 Will you meet with Osman as soon as you see him? 

1070
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,320
 Duh. 

1071
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,120
 You don't know either. 

1072
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,180
 Do you know what happened? 

1073
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:02,720
 They found the bundle you sent to Batur in the forest. 

1074
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,020
 What was he doing in the woods? 

1075
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,260
 You gave it to me ... 

1076
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:11,120
 ... I gave it to Bala, it is the trust of his mother ... 

1077
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,260
 ... to deliver it to Batur. 

1078
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,780
 So? 

1079
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,920
 The Eee. 

1080
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,580
 Blood everywhere. 

1081
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,640
 The bundle just stands on one side. 

1082
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,880
 Is he dead? 

1083
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,540
 I repent. 

1084
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,460
 The Lost Bala Hatun. 

1085
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:43,860
 May Allah give you a thesis time. 

1086
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,100
 Let's say Mr. Dundar. 

1087
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,160
 Maybe he can do something. 

1088
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,200
 No, thank you. 

1089
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,360
 Let's never say to Dundar Bey. 

1090
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:57,600
 They are looking for a nudge. 

1091
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,540
 Evelallah he will find it 

1092
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,340
 Hopefully Selcan Hatun. 

1093
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,380
 God willing. 

1094
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:08,340
 Well. 

1095
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,560
 If you get any news ... 

1096
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,180
 ... tell us too. 

1097
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,980
 Our mother Mary ... 

1098
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,240
 bless you Sofia. 

1099
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,600
 In our sacred case ... 

1100
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,900
 ... to destroy the enemy ... 

1101
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,160
 ... add strength to your strength. 

1102
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,660
 Today... 

1103
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,920
 ... we've been waiting for years ... 

1104
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,820
 ... we will reach the result. 

1105
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,800
 On behalf of master Yannis. 

1106
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,720
 You will come across ... 

1107
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,700
 ... will cut all obstacles. 

1108
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,300
 On behalf of master Yannis. 

1109
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,320
 Master Yannis. 

1110
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:14,460
 While returning, my reputation was destroyed ... 

1111
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,740
 ... I will bring an exhausted Osman. 

1112
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,500
 What they gave us ... 

1113
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,520
 ... will pay the price. 

1114
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,080
 You... 

1115
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,520
 ... you are the leaders of my army. 

1116
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:26,520
 Prior to... 

1117
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:28,480
 Princess Sofia first. 

1118
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:35,300
 Then... 

1119
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:36,600
 Andreas. 

1120
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,060
 And Helen you. 

1121
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,640
 And of course ... 

1122
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,080
 Salvador. 

1123
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:51,820
 Today... 

1124
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:53,940
 ... it's your destiny day. 

1125
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:56,140
 Success of your ... 

1126
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,880
 ... you will take your share. 

1127
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:04,580
 Or... 

1128
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,180
 ... from our overwhelming power ... 

1129
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:09,240
 Dear sacrifice to our cause, sir. 

1130
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,760
 My sons. 

1131
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,460
 Stand up. 

1132
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:20,860
 Go and pull your swords. 

1133
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,560
 Our way ... 

1134
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,340
 ... land bushes ... 

1135
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,480
 ... clean. 

1136
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:26,680
 Usman ... 

1137
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,060
 ... capturing dead or alive ... 

1138
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,860
 ... bring it to me. 

1139
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:31,820
 Go ... 

1140
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:32,640
 ... your way ... 

1141
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:34,260
 .... be clear. 

1142
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,020
 On behalf of master Yannis. 

1143
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,380
 Samsa ... 

1144
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:41,360
 ... your time has come. 

1145
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,800
 It is martyrdom. 

1146
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,900
 This is our head. 

1147
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,920
 Is Allahuekber. 

1148
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,820
 Bey. 

1149
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:29,000
 Çetinalp! 

1150
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,100
 Çetinalp! 

1151
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,980
 Çetinalp! 

1152
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:32,640
 My brother. 

1153
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,800
 Often your sister. 

1154
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:31,300
 We were enough, Samsa! 

1155
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,340
 Samsa Bey. 

1156
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:16,420
 The persecutions you suffered ... 

1157
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:19,300
 ... do you think he'll stay with you? 

1158
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,880
 The blood of all our martyrs ... 

1159
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:38,020
 ... would we leave it on the ground? 

1160
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,640
 We forgive ... 

1161
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,080
 ... do you think we forget? 

1162
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,040
 I will drown you in your blood. 

1163
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,060
 Stop. 

1164
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:31,360
 What did you bring me, Sofia? 

1165
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:47,020
 Who are those who want to keep my heart pleasant? 

1166
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,300
 Tekfur in the vicinity. 

1167
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:52,260
 To report their commitment to you ... 

1168
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:54,140
 ... they send these gifts. 

1169
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:57,880
 This evening, you and the tekfur in the pen ... 

1170
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,960
 ... I will host. 

1171
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:05,840
 Did they send you this gold because they were afraid to come to my room? 

1172
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,700
 It can be said so. 

1173
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:10,440
 Just the way you want it. 

1174
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,240
 They took refuge in me from your fear. 

1175
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:17,060
 It's all in the palm of our hand. 

1176
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,300
 They are all scared. 

1177
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,000
 And helpless. 

1178
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:25,480
 They will not obey the might Balgay ... 

1179
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:27,820
 what will they do? 

1180
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,080
 My two best scouts. 

1181
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,900
 To find Samsa Bey. 

1182
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,620
 He will guide you on Şahin Hill. 

1183
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,820
 Superb. 

1184
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,620
 You get up, get close! 

1185
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:03,200
 Who is this booger? 

1186
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:06,860
 Osman's most trusted man. 

1187
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,480
 So, by making Osman believe that he is a Muslim, 

1188
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,280
 ... you are at your command. 

1189
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:18,220
 Yes, the mighty Balgay. 

1190
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:23,340
 Did you find out where Osman was? 

1191
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,200
 No strong Balgay. 

1192
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,080
 But... 

1193
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:31,620
 ... I learned where Edibali is. 

1194
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,180
 Commander of ... 

1195
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:36,100
 ... while finishing Samsa's work on Şahin Hill ... 

1196
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,660
 I will also take Edibalı. 

1197
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:52,620
 Just me... 

1198
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:56,380
 ... my warrior queen Sofia. 

1199
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:58,280
 Evening... 

1200
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:03,980
 ..the head of Edibali's daughter who fled before the offerings ... 

1201
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,300
 ... I'll put it at your feet. 

1202
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,460
 I hope your soldiers will bring the head of Osman's Alps. 

1203
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,900
 Today... 

1204
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:29,560
 ... blood day of the souls Sofia. 

1205
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:34,780
 Dark souls are so hungry ... 

1206
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:42,400
 Saturate them without finding Osman ... 

1207
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,980
 ... it won't be easy. 

1208
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,380
 Never 

1209
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:04,460
 Take your tongue. 

1210
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,980
 I will blow your mind before the flesh. 

1211
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,440
 Let's see what he knew. 

1212
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:11,640
 You are more ... 

1213
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,680
 ... you don't know who you rebel against. 

1214
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:17,060
 I'll show you all. 

1215
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:19,260
 To all of you! 

1216
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:21,940
 I will show you. 

1217
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,180
 Alps... 

1218
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,760
 ... look at the injured. 

1219
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:50,880
 May you exist, Osman Bey. 

1220
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,080
 You took us from the clutches of the jam. 

1221
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:01,460
 While it was a donut on our head, 

1222
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:05,340
 ... the separation does not suit us, Samsa Bey. 

1223
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,340
 I said toy. 

1224
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:14,340
 I said it does not work. 

1225
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,640
 But you made my defect clear. 

1226
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,900
 I am embarrassed for your right to embarrass. 

1227
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,400
 My right is halal forever. 

1228
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,800
 All Kayı fathers speak of their bravery. 

1229
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:31,900
 With your courage, you hope for the oppressed Samsa Bey. 

1230
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:37,320
 I did what was useful to Kayı Bey. 

1231
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,140
 Enemy arc 

1232
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,880
 ... the road is long. 

1233
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:49,160
 But I see ... 

1234
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:51,460
 ... comrade is tough. 

1235
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:55,300
 With your heart and your pus ... 

1236
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,120
 ... there is Samsa Bey. 

1237
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:00,280
 May you have it, Osman Bey. 

1238
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,920
 Hullo. 

1239
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:22,940
 Thank you for my bravery. 

1240
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,220
 Non... 

1241
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:29,860
 ..yigit yigide ... 

1242
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,120
 ..dağ has reached the mountain. 

1243
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:37,420
 Consider informal rest. 

1244
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:10,280
 My Day ... 

1245
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:12,200
 ... where are you going? 

1246
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:16,580
 After the Night ... 

1247
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:18,100
 ... I sent a pioneer to the Alps. 

1248
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,020
 There is still no news. 

1249
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:21,700
 I can't stop informally. 

1250
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,780
 I have to give the brother a shoulder. 

1251
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,580
 My Day ... 

1252
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:27,140
 Osman escaped and saved himself. 

1253
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:28,820
 It will surely release news. 

1254
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:30,020
 Babes! 

1255
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:32,140
 My brother is on his way to honor ... 

1256
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:34,100
 ... who knows what when fighting with Mogul. 

1257
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:34,980
 Ban falling ... 

1258
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:36,460
 ... the tent is not waiting. 

1259
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:42,180
 To join Osman in the square. 

1260
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,560
 Ayse! 

1261
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,300
 You will not step on that bed. 

1262
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:51,600
 You won't even enter the tent of anyone who says Emmime Bey. 

1263
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:54,900
 My Day ... 

1264
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,860
 Take care of yourself for God's sake. 

1265
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:00,820
 Be entrusted to my Lord. 

1266
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,680
 You too, babe. 

1267
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,000
 Weed. 

1268
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,480
 Don't mess with us! 

1269
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:21,400
 I will be all of you. 

1270
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,760
 Mongol's might ... 

1271
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:25,780
 ... I will teach you all. 

1272
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,000
 Now... 

1273
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,580
 ... tell what you know one by one. 

1274
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:37,380
 Alps... 

1275
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:38,900
 ... stop. 

1276
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:41,520
 Many innocents have blood in their hands. 

1277
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,440
 Thank you very much. 

1278
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:44,940
 He is a prisoner. 

1279
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,080
 Whatever happens... 

1280
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,300
 ... treating the prisoner like this is useless. 

1281
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:50,880
 You go. 

1282
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,680
 I will make him sing. 

1283
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,920
 Who called you Kongar? 

1284
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,220
 Say, well. 

1285
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:24,780
 Who gave you this name. 

1286
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,080
 Step ... 

1287
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:28,880
 He put a great scale. 

1288
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:31,900
 In the wars, let me have a name. 

1289
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:38,720
 What's in your neck? 

1290
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,280
 What should I know? 

1291
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,720
 Look ban. 

1292
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,280
 Why do I have the same? 

1293
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,040
 Say, well. 

1294
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,960
 Do you question me, walk me. 

1295
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:52,880
 Göktuğ ... 

1296
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:55,860
 ...my brother. 

1297
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:59,140
 You are my brother. 

1298
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:03,540
 I'm your brother too. 

1299
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:06,900
 I thread. 

1300
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:09,420
 My Brother's My Place. 

1301
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:12,980
 You me ... 

1302
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:15,120
 ... have you documented honey in the crib? 

1303
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:18,060
 Does Kongar come to these games? Hee? 

1304
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:23,140
 Mongolian martyred ... 

1305
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:25,480
 Who do you think killed our father? 

1306
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,760
 Who? 

1307
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,160
 I'm Mongolian! 

1308
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,840
 My parents died in warlord. 

1309
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,360
 Göktuğ ... 

1310
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,400
 They killed your soul. 

1311
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:40,420
 They took your mind. 

1312
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,660
 This trail ... 

1313
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,160
 ..o our burned obese. 

1314
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:48,600
 How would you forget Göktuğ? 

1315
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,840
 How? 

1316
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,740
 Father? 

1317
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,840
 Kont Göktuğ ... 

1318
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,840
 Father... 

1319
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:04,640
 I'm mongolian! 

1320
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:06,520
 Mongolian! 

1321
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:08,720
 This birthmark ... 

1322
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,520
 Our grandfather Tekin Alp ... 

1323
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,220
 assume you forgot our mother who was killed. 

1324
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:20,980
 You forgot what's ahead! 

1325
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:26,220
 We set up in front of him ... 

1326
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:29,820
 For the sake of dying ... 

1327
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,280
 Did you forget your promise? 

1328
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,080
 Say Göktuğ! 

1329
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,000
 Did you forget them too? 

1330
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,000
 Brother... 

1331
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:53,160
 Brother... 

1332
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:54,940
 My brother. 

1333
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:17,540
 It is put up, brother. 

1334
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:20,140
 Bring that shit here. 

1335
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,440
 Listen to me carefully. 

1336
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,160
 While I was here ... 

1337
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:31,140
 ... nobody says anything to you. 

1338
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,360
 As long as they don't chew me. 

1339
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:35,160
 They can't touch you. 

1340
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:36,540
 Did you hear me? 

1341
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:38,780
 Nobody says anything to you. 

1342
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,660
 Do not be afraid. 

1343
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,120
 Do not be afraid. 

1344
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:42,120
 Do not! 

1345
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:56,420
 Walk the Mongolian dog. 

1346
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:58,160
 Get up! Mongolian dog. Walk! 

1347
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:08,320
 Late! 

1348
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,400
 Where are you going day? 

1349
02:07:55,940 --> 02:07:58,760
 Or do you have new news to Gayhatu? 

1350
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:01,320
 What Gayhatus are you talking about? 

1351
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:05,440
 Balgay knows everything. 

1352
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:09,100
 You will come with me. 

1353
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:11,700
 What if I don't come? 

1354
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,900
 I tell you ... 

1355
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:59,700
 ... I didn't want to come with me 

1356
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:03,480
 I said you will come with me. 

1357
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:07,160
 What is it? 

1358
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,200
 A Mongolian ... 

1359
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:11,080
 ... if he makes a command ... 

1360
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:14,300
 ... you will fulfill. 

1361
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:25,200
 You did a good job, Salvador. 

1362
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:27,880
 Osman and the Alps will be here soon. 

1363
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,200
 Surround everywhere. 

1364
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:35,960
 None of them will survive here. 

1365
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:10,600
 Why is that? 

1366
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:14,640
 Why did you report to Gayhatu? 

1367
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:16,440
 Day. 

1368
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:22,080
 Who said that to you? 

1369
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:33,140
 Since Balgay is your enemy. 

1370
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:36,040
 You will settle for your fate. 

1371
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,260
 Who makes your mind blurred? 

1372
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:46,260
 I do not know but... 

1373
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,780
 The death of those who defeated the Kayi ... 

1374
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,640
 ... how do you know? 

1375
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:01,380
 Sure you will know. 

1376
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:04,200
 Hahaha... 

1377
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,700
 You were gruff in Boskır. 

1378
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:10,140
 Same in Willow. 

1379
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:16,420
 Your feather doesn't change. 

1380
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:18,860
 But your temper is the same. 

1381
02:12:19,780 --> 02:12:22,060
 Informal pursuit of blood ... 

1382
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:23,940
 ... Cergutay. 

1383
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,520
 If I don't buy ... 

1384
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:31,360
 Osman will take your life. 

1385
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:34,340
 You will go and go. 

1386
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:18,680
 I am the sky. 

1387
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:20,180
 And hey hello. 

1388
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,260
 Selamunaleyküm Şeyhim. 

1389
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:32,400
 And hey hello. 

1390
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:34,480
 I brought the greetings of my Osman Bey. 

1391
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,160
 Salvador! 

1392
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,280
 Traitor dog! 

1393
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:03,580
 Kill them all. 

1394
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:11,460
 It is hard to be Turkish, Sofia. 

1395
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,120
 For the oppressed. 

1396
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,460
 You are oppressed. 

1397
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:23,100
 It is harder not to be a Turk. 

1398
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:28,620
 Because.. 

1399
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:31,260
 You take the Turk. 

1400
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,680
 We will dry your root. 

1401
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:53,480
 Shut up! 

1402
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:05,680
 Walk! 

1403
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:43,420
 Sentence news to the world. 

1404
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:47,460
 7 heifers are one and it doesn't matter if it comes over us! 

1405
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:51,160
 Osman's war has begun. 

1406
02:17:51,340 --> 02:18:03,120
 Allahu Akbar!

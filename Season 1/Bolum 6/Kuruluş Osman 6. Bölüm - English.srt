1
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:11,780
 Yannis ... 

2
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,480
 Where's the literary? 

3
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,680
 I am here because he is not there, Osman. 

4
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,800
 Defraud the word! Answer my question. 

5
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,260
 Edebali and her daughter are gone. 

6
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
 But I don't know where they are. 

7
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,920
 It will not take long. 

8
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,900
 Remember that it is at the tip of my claw. 

9
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,160
 Killing me ... 

10
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,585
 Osman is the last thing you want right now. 

11
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,315
 Demon. 

12
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,140
 Selcan Hatun. 

13
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,800
 What are you saying? 

14
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,765
 Selcan Hatun is not even in the willow. 

15
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:01,165
 Your anger overshadowed your intelligence, Osman. 

16
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:05,535
 You forget that we have a dark shadow in every nook. 

17
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:09,425
 What did you do to Selcan Hatun? 

18
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,585
 You, not us, will decide. 

19
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,035
 Now in the caravanserai, unaware of everything ... 

20
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:19,535
 ... he is staying. 

21
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,260
 Welcome, Princess Sofia. 

22
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,260
 We're [I'm] glad to be here. 

23
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,380
 What are you looking for, Selcan Hatun? 

24
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,640
 My dagger is here, but Hayme Ana's ... 

25
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,000
 ... I can't find an heirloom dagger. 

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,640
 You go ahead and eat. 

27
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,840
 Here my princess 

28
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,580
 To that table ... 

29
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,895
 ... send fruit with plenty of goat meat 

30
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,280
 What's up? 

31
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 What are these? 

32
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,680
 Kulucahisar princess is the treat of Sofia ... 

33
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,100
 ... Selcan hatun 

34
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,585
 If I don't survive here ... 

35
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,515
 ... I'm a man outside ... 

36
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:46,075
 ... he's waiting to fly news to the caravanserai. 

37
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:11,355
 Are you ready to negotiate with your devil, Osman? 

38
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:21,925
 What do you want? 

39
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,660
 For my dear ... 

40
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,980
 ... Selcan's soul. 

41
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,160
 you are lying 

42
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,200
 To get rid of my hand ... 

43
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,980
 a lie you made up. 

44
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:01,415
 I am grateful that you accepted my offer. 

45
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,145
 It's not a holiday, it's not watching ... 

46
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,325
 ... why are you served? 

47
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:11,735
 You are a guest. 

48
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,735
 The catering to the guest is from the glory of the host. 

49
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,295
 Can I sit? 

50
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,705
 The fool of the guest thought he was the host. 

51
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:36,275
 This dormitory is ours. 

52
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
 As for the guest, 

53
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,380
 If you agree to be a guest at my desk ... 

54
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
 ... come on, sit down. 

55
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:49,595
 As you wish. 

56
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,520
 So, you are the famous Selcan Hatun. 

57
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,940
 He saw the day in Kulucahisar 

58
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,220
 Even Greek women praise your name. 

59
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,460
 We look at the stove, not the fire. 

60
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:24,935
 Although Nam is ours, the trick is Hayme Mother. 

61
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,085
 I am sure... 

62
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,605
 ... grandson of Hayme Ana ... 

63
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:31,955
 ...Mr. Osman. 

64
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:39,775
 He will be very happy to see you. 

65
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:46,245
 Kinship is also howling princess. 

66
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:49,455
 However, Osman is my child. 

67
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,380
 Elbet, I miss him too. 

68
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 Well, let's see 

69
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,300
 Why is this relation to Osman? 

70
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,220
 Osman Bey found the murderers of my husband and sentenced him. 

71
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,740
 In our eyes, its value is great. 

72
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,600
 Did you recognize this dagger, Osman? 

73
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:44,585
 Hayme Ana 

74
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:49,935
 If you say no to my offer, Selcan Hatun ... 

75
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,180
 ... will need this dagger a lot. 

76
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,540
 My main is half. If you do any harm to her ... 

77
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,980
 ... if you are in the well where there are snakes, I will take you off with my hands. 

78
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,020
 Osman is not over yet. 

79
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,600
 Not only my dear, but Aybars ... 

80
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,360
 ... I will give the murderers. 

81
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,395
 Subject... 

82
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,800
 You will not sound my execution. 

83
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,320
 Selcan Hatun? 

84
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,760
 It will reach the plain unharmed. Now think well. 

85
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,040
 Either leaving here and going to the castle ... 

86
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,320
 ... testify to my execution 

87
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 or .. 

88
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:40,105
 Taking revenge on Aybars' murderers ... 

89
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,360
 ... turning to oba 

90
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,580
 You will get Selcan Hatun, which you love as much as your mother. 

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
 This was a big game, wasn't it? 

92
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,525
 I am the only one who knows you. 

93
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:01,675
 You will be lost and disappear. 

94
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,425
 Here is Osman Bey I know 

95
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:05,420
 it. 

96
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,180
 Both brave and intelligent. 

97
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,040
 Don't forget that I am brutal! 

98
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 I... 

99
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:16,165
 I'm a dead man, Osman. 

100
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,780
 Where are Aybars murderers? 

101
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,100
 They're in the black forest right now. 

102
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,960
 At the beginning ... 

103
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,215
 ... there is Salvador. 

104
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,195
 Mr. Osman! 

105
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,385
 Hurry up. 

106
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:53,665
 Who will hurt this time ... 

107
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:57,505
 I can't even take a nap. 

108
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,295
 This isn't over, Yannis. 

109
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,485
 In those dark shadows 

110
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:06,525
 that bat on your face 

111
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,535
 I will drown with the light of my pus, you know. 

112
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:29,925
 Our holy cause is for our master Yannis. 

113
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,125
 For our holy cause and master Yannis. 

114
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,965
 Thanks to Osman Bey 

115
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:03,475
 into this land 

116
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,055
 we cut out a big ur. 

117
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:10,165
 Osman, as much as a hunter ... 

118
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,485
 ... proved to be a great Bey. 

119
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,935
 Why did Osman not come? 

120
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,565
 You need to know that, Mr. Bamsi. 

121
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:30,795
 Not in Sofia. 

122
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:32,255
 Mr. Gündüz, 

123
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,035
 There's a hell going around here. 

124
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,060
 When my Osman comes, I will learn all of them. 

125
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,520
 So, where's Osman Osman Dundar? 

126
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,320
 Is there any reason that makes Osman's works a secret? 

127
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,560
 You'll see, it ends soon. 

128
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,480
 Ea ... 

129
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,580
 now this carcass ... 

130
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,580
 ... What do you know is Yannis melunu? 

131
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
 What if? 

132
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,580
 Osman is the only one who knows him other than us. 

133
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,380
 He did not come to death. 

134
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
 Trust us, Mr. Bamsi. 

135
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,120
 Even the carcass of someone like Yannis 

136
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,940
 It pollutes Kulucahisar's air. 

137
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
 Take it. 

138
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 Mr. Alişar 

139
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,020
 while you are here 

140
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,960
 Old agreement in your hospitality 

141
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,660
 we wish to renew. 

142
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,460
 Here you are, Hazrat Alişar. 

143
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,440
 Mr. Dundar. 

144
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,540
 Day 

145
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,960
 I'm not comfortable at all. 

146
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,260
 Your uncle is still pursuing an agreement. 

147
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
 My Osman is still not around. 

148
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
 Don't worry, Mr. Bamsi 

149
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
 the basics of this agreement 

150
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
 my father Ertuğrul Gazi threw. 

151
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
 Ertuğrul Bey, this agreement 

152
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
 He hoped to do it with Yorgo Pulos. 

153
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,960
 This is not with couds. 

154
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,960
 Mr. Gündüz ... 

155
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,300
 not with these couds. 

156
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,000
 not with it 

157
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
 where are you my dear 

158
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,180
 Where? 

159
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 Duh! 

160
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
 Duh! 

161
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
 No, no? 

162
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,780
 As if he had received good news 

163
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,060
 You have a condition. 

164
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,540
 Thank god it will cost you a lot 

165
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,960
 They dealt with an unpleasant issue. 

166
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,960
 Your foot came auspicious. 

167
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
 For your guest curtain 

168
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,960
 thank you. 

169
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,960
 I'm glad to meet you. 

170
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,660
 If you let me 

171
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,480
 you and Zöhre Hatun 

172
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,980
 I would like to visit in Obanız. 

173
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,960
 Of course. 

174
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,120
 Our door is always open to friends. 

175
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
 (Salutes) 

176
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,460
 Aybüke, who are they? 

177
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
 I couldn't take it out, Selcan Hatun. 

178
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,440
 Beautiful girl, who are you from? 

179
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,900
 Where does it come from, where do you go? 

180
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,940
 Ahi Evran with his comrade ahiler ... 

181
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
 We remember Fatma aunty Yaren. 

182
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,960
 Who is this four man with you? 

183
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,160
 My father. 

184
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,680
 Is Sheikh Edebali. 

185
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,960
 Can I disturb if I come to your side? 

186
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,480
 My father also loves to pray and mother. 

187
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,960
 On the contrary, he would be pleased. 

188
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,460
 Hay, thank you. 

189
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,600
 You shine like dir, my beautiful girl. 

190
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
 Let me illuminate my path. 

191
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 Estağfirullah, chick. 

192
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,340
 If we had allowed you, we would have shown our respect, sir. 

193
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,120
 Adap, claw in front of a mortal ... 

194
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,840
 ... the sofa is not stopping, chick. 

195
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,580
 Edep in the face of the glory of the Creator ... 

196
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
 ... knowing your absence, nothingness. 

197
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
 Hay, thank you. 

198
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,960
 They did not call you Turkmen Husband in vain. 

199
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,040
 You entered the big caravanserai with your light, shaken it with your majesty ... 

200
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,960
 ... you burned with wisdom. 

201
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
 Excuse me. 

202
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
 Can you donate your name, babe? 

203
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,680
 The mother of martyr, martyred court, Selcan Hatun from apricot. 

204
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
 [They're swelling the sword. ] 

205
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 [Laughter sounds.] 

206
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,540
 Be careful just in case brothers. 

207
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
 Storm! 

208
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,940
 Hello, sir. 

209
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,440
 You hold the Kangaroo and Boğaç right side. 

210
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,200
 Don't let anyone escape. 

211
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,740
 Thank you, Mr. 

212
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
 Lets! 

213
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,760
 Hold the back side with Onur, Demir bent and Erkut. 

214
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
 We will attack with my sign. 

215
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,920
 There is no scabbard to enter pusat in our waist from now on. 

216
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,420
 Gayz who will damn the bail ... 

217
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,780
 There is a grudge that will cause cruel blood. 

218
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,920
 Either martyrdom or victorious. 

219
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,420
 So we'll burn Samsan's Obasi. 

220
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,300
 We came, after that only the angel of death will circulate in this land. 

221
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
 [ah! ] 

222
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
 (what is happening?) 

223
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,720
 You know I lost my chick. 

224
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,260
 If you consent, I would like to crown the girl's Aygül in my mansion. 

225
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,680
 Alişar Bey. 

226
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,040
 Mr. Dundar. 

227
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,420
 I am very sorry that I made you wait but ... 

228
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,400
 ... the texts of the agreement you are curiously waiting for are ready. 

229
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,500
 Since the traitor Yannis died too ... 

230
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,280
 ... there is no obstacle to seal the agreement. 

231
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,160
 Will the agreement be made when Osman disappears? 

232
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
 Mr. Dundar? 

233
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,320
 We also speak of big, shush is small. 

234
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,720
 When it comes to the subject of the agreement, with my brother's duty ... 

235
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
 ...seal 

236
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,420
 is in my hands 

237
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,720
 Dundar Bey 

238
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,140
 Princess Sofia 

239
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,860
 At one time I had seen a beautiful flower on the Caspian coast. 

240
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,700
 The smell is still in my nose. 

241
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,420
 Every time I see you, that flower comes to my mind. 

242
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
 And how toxic it is. 

243
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
 [Or to] 

244
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 Where is Salvador? 

245
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
 Where is Slavador? 

246
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,180
 Do not bother Osman Bey. 

247
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
 He will find you. 

248
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,620
 The Yannis demon who harmed our friend found the trouble. 

249
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,700
 Informal is the time to make our friend permanent. 

250
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,500
 But last time you tried to make a deal without me. 

251
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,080
 And, there's no work left for you. 

252
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,600
 Without the consent of Alişar Bey in these tupras ... 

253
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,060
 ... no flowers are pierced. 

254
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,140
 Now... 

255
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,200
 Let's live the memory of my late husband Yorgo Pulos together. 

256
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,480
 Let's renew the deal. 

257
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,900
 Let's finish the work started by Dündar Bey together. 

258
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,600
 Moreover, unlike the old agreement, Dundar Bey wanted the matter of confederation ... 

259
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,320
 ... added to the deal. 

260
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,440
 Are the items we want in the agreement? 

261
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,160
 There are, Dündar Bey. 

262
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,360
 Mr. Alişar, as if you have no trust in us. 

263
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
 You read the items very carefully. 

264
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,520
 Without care, there is no reputation Calosnose. 

265
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,160
 You will give Aybars account! 

266
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,820
 You will give Aybars' account! 

267
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,620
 You give! 

268
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,400
 You will be notified when they make you talk. 

269
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,560
 Storm 

270
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,500
 Hello, sir. 

271
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,240
 My Selcan aunt is here, I have to go to the thesis. 

272
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,660
 Take this push to our place. 

273
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,560
 Speak until late at night. 

274
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,660
 Don't worry, sir. 

275
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,840
 If the snake was, the nightingale would be cut, evelAllah. 

276
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,120
 Samsa sergeant, you go to oban. Wait for news from me. 

277
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
 Selcan Hatun. 

278
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
 Among all these problems, this was missing. 

279
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,120
 Thank goodness, I saw Selcan Hatun once again with the eyes of the world. 

280
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
 Ayse. 

281
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 Aunt, welcome. 

282
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 My beautiful daughter. 

283
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,160
 Welcome, Selcan yenge. 

284
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
 I Aygül. 

285
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
 Welcome, Selcan yenge. 

286
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,320
 We enjoyed it. 

287
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
 Welcome, Selcan Hatun. 

288
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,340
 What it was like a Zöhre lime well swim. 

289
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,600
 Give it a surprise, babe. 

290
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,380
 Thanks God. 

291
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,220
 Where's my black-eyed Osman? 

292
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:39,120
 Come on I said, you put Osman in caged tents. 

293
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,600
 The mountains of Söğüd mean that the stones have been spoken. 

294
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
 Across the Selcan line, all creatures are expressed ... 

295
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,120
 don't you know, Zöhre? 

296
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,480
 Come on chatter, where's my Osman? 

297
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,920
 Mr. Dundar said that a caged tent comes from him ... 

298
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,580
 ... cut his own punishment. 

299
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,460
 He came from him. 

300
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,600
 Now, where does God know? 

301
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,620
 Of course, Osman knows that he could not fit in his neck even as a child. 

302
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,360
 Aygül, bring me a buttermilk. My lung became dust. 

303
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,120
 Right now, Selcan aunt. 

304
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
 Here you go. 

305
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,700
 Here, Selcan hatun. 

306
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,320
 Ertuğrul You established your car in the shadow of my bey's bed. 

307
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,940
 But don't you know, weed doesn't end in the shadow of his bed. 

308
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,720
 Although Dundar does not have a good place for my gentleman, we will live and thank him. 

309
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,360
 May God give you and your loved ones a long life. 

310
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,200
 Amine. 

311
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,160
 Amine. 

312
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,680
 Our face faces the black winter, migration is not smoothed this season. 

313
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,860
 No, is it bad or Selcan hatun? 

314
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,320
 God knows both the good and the bad. 

315
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,600
 What's up? Are you afraid that we might be disturbed? 

316
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,360
 Estağfirullah. 

317
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,580
 My concern is because of you. 

318
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
 There is nothing bad insha'Allah? 

319
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,860
 I'm tired, Zöhre. 

320
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 My obese is tired. 

321
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,060
 After Gündoğdum passed to the hereafter, it was not stopped there. 

322
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,880
 Before I came, my oban will be on the way in time, insha'Allah. 

323
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,220
 insha'Allah. 

324
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,280
 Who are these wilds? 

325
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,220
 These are snakes. 

326
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,420
 Snake. 

327
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
 Me too... 

328
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,560
 ... I also have a trust that burdened my shoulders. 

329
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,700
 These angels are the murderers of my brother Aybars. 

330
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,160
 They also have heads. 

331
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
 I'll bring it to you, too. 

332
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,320
 He's not a crap, Yannis, right? 

333
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,120
 It's the head of the snake, I grabbed it from its tail. 

334
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,380
 We will crush your head, evelallah. 

335
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
 Don't worry. 

336
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
 Now... 

337
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,520
 ... take your revenge beyond me, Bamsı. 

338
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,840
 Although the blood flowing from them is like the water of the Alaca river ... 

339
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,820
 ... guinea does not cool my pain. 

340
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,240
 I Uthman ... 

341
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,220
 You exist. 

342
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,860
 You exist. 

343
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,100
 I have eaten your right, Osman. 

344
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,760
 I forgot Aybars, I would remember 

345
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,880
 In our race ... 

346
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
 ... there is no forgetting Burçin chick. 

347
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,380
 Mr. Bamsi ... 

348
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
 Souls! 

349
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,360
 Siblings! 

350
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,200
 Sisters! 

351
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,300
 Yarenler! 

352
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,200
 Today is the day when the fire inside me cools. 

353
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,000
 Today... 

354
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,620
 ... my martyr, Aybars 

355
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,120
 is the day of revenge. 

356
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
 These snakes thought ... 

357
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,480
 ... we forget our pain, we don't go after it. 

358
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,640
 These snakes thought ... 

359
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,640
 ... we are not accountable. 

360
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
 But... 

361
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,340
 ... black Osman ... 

362
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,880
 ... he grabbed them with his paw like an eagle and threw them in front of me. 

363
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,740
 Now... 

364
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,380
 ... me too .... 

365
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,380
 ... their poisonous head was removed from their tails. 

366
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
 (God!) 

367
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
 Allahu akbar. 

368
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
 Allahu akbar. 

369
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,040
 (Long live my Osman!) 

370
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,180
 (My life is Bamsı Bey!) 

371
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,100
 (Long live my Osman!) 

372
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,840
 (My life is Bamsı Bey!) 

373
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,340
 (Long live my Osman!) 

374
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,200
 (My life is Bamsı Bey!) 

375
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,680
 (Long live my Osman!) 

376
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,520
 (My life is Bamsı Bey!) 

377
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,640
 (My life is Bamsı Bey!) 

378
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,940
 (Long live my Osman!) 

379
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,320
 (Long live my Osman!) 

380
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,820
 (My life is Bamsı Bey!) 

381
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,240
 The day is that all the snakes trying to infiltrate the Turkish heart ... 

382
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,700
 ... is the day of cutting his head. 

383
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,580
 Day... 

384
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,720
 ... our faith ... 

385
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,500
 ... It's time to walk to the Red Apple. 

386
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,160
 I am the valiant Osman of Karagöz. 

387
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,480
 Welcome, aunt. 

388
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,280
 I found it nice. 

389
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,660
 When I saw you, I saw the rest and the tolerant, my son, insha'Allah. 

390
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,860
 Come, let's move on to my father's bed. 

391
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,900
 He found Tekvur's murderer, found Aybars' murderers and brought them to the camp. 

392
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,080
 Osman became a waterfall flood. 

393
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,980
 I'll stop him in front of him ... 

394
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,900
 ... or the flow will destroy us all. 

395
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,120
 The lion of his father ... 

396
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,860
 ... good fortune, Osman. 

397
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
 Osman... 

398
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,340
 ... drop eyelashes over your eyes. 

399
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,600
 What's poking your mind? Say it to me. 

400
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,600
 I saw you like this, my sister. 

401
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,520
 ... there is no problem, alhamdulillah. 

402
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,800
 Here you go. 

403
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
 Oh, my Osman. 

404
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,840
 Thank goodness you ended. 

405
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,980
 Kayı obaları unites. 

406
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,640
 Day will come... 

407
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,800
 ... sentence Oğuz obaları will be united. 

408
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,540
 It will be strong. 

409
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
 Hopefully, my lion. 

410
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,180
 God willing. 

411
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,660
 I heard you went to the caravanserai? 

412
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,540
 Yeah. 

413
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,000
 I went. 

414
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,020
 What's up? 

415
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,520
 Osman... 

416
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,540
 ... where did you find this dagger? 

417
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,960
 Has anyone caught your attention in Caravanserai? 

418
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,360
 It did. 

419
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,080
 The princess of Kulucahisar. 

420
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,940
 He came to me. 

421
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,280
 Sofia. 

422
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,600
 Sofia. 

423
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:40,980
 But what could Sofia have to do with this dagger, son? 

424
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,660
 For your life ... 

425
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,580
 ... they asked me to forgive someone's life. 

426
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,120
 What are you saying? 

427
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,440
 Sofia? 

428
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,600
 Yannis. 

429
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,040
 Who is in Yannis? 

430
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,720
 We'll talk tonight, aunt. 

431
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,520
 I Uthman ... 

432
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,600
 ... when I arrived in the caravanserai ... 

433
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,900
 ... I saw the blessed face of Sheikh Edbali. 

434
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,360
 What are you saying aunt? 

435
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,920
 Yeah. 

436
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,500
 Your face shone like the moon, my lion. 

437
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,460
 What's up? 

438
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,900
 You gave me very important news. 

439
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
 What about her daughter? 

440
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,580
 Was her daughter with you? 

441
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,080
 You call the bala chick? 

442
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,580
 Yeah. 

443
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,100
 Of course. 

444
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,300
 We also met him. 

445
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
 Where did you revolt? 

446
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,500
 I must go to the caravanserai. 

447
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,900
 We have a lot of issues to talk about tonight. 

448
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,120
 My death will make them so much fun ... 

449
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,740
 ...I have never thought of that. 

450
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,560
 (laughs) 

451
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,780
 The Edebali ... 

452
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,220
 he will think you're dead, sir. 

453
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
 Thus, it will move more comfortably. 

454
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,040
 If it was that easy ... 

455
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,660
 ... I would have died already. 

456
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,820
 Prince Salvador. 

457
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,920
 Osman... 

458
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,400
 ... trapped, sir. 

459
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,240
 Now it's time ... 

460
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
 ... the big wolf. 

461
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,940
 I thought you would be sorry for your warriors ... 

462
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,880
 Prince Salvador. 

463
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,460
 It may upset me just to be deviated from my ideals, commander. 

464
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,860
 Is our direction clear? 

465
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,180
 Of course it is, my moth. 

466
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,320
 Our direction is immediate. 

467
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,400
 Amenna sir. 

468
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:46,860
 Amenna sir. 

469
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,880
 My comrades ... 

470
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,720
 ... more than being born a Muslim and being a Muslim ... 

471
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
 ... to stay Muslim. 

472
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,920
 Let the ember be gadr us, let the ember take us from our dormitories. 

473
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,060
 The rose in the bush does not end, saying ignorant is not enough ... 

474
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,280
 ... we will continue on our way. 

475
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,900
 We will not deviate from our direction. 

476
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
 Remember, the lovers ... 

477
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,340
 ... the spiritual reward for those who do not submit to persecution ... 

478
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,060
 ... is honor and majesty. 

479
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,560
 Thank you, sir. 

480
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,620
 Thank you, sir. 

481
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,120
 Sir... 

482
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,740
 ... We hear news that Yannis was killed. 

483
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
 They threw a piece of bread on the mouse ... 

484
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,420
 ... the awake mouse looked at the ground and the piece of bread. 

485
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,660
 He said there is something odd about this. 

486
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,280
 Bread is big ... 

487
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,640
 ... and the distance is short. 

488
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,200
 What is your doubt, sir? 

489
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,760
 Yannis ... 

490
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,520
 ... big bait. 

491
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,320
 Moreover, it is thought-provoking to get out of it so easily. 

492
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,540
 In my opinion, a girl like Sofia ... 

493
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,480
 never consents to his father's execution. 

494
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,760
 Their intentions are also clear. 

495
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,260
 You know the location of the treasure ... 

496
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,260
 ... don't they know that? 

497
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,840
 They know. 

498
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:25,960
 They know. 

499
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,720
 For this reason, they will throw their clamps to Osman. 

500
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,900
 Get in his way ... 

501
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,560
 ... they will wish to distract you. 

502
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,480
 Akcam ... 

503
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,600
 ... Osman went to death? 

504
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,880
 It's not gone, sir. 

505
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,280
 So his trial began with the devil. 

506
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,240
 When he learned that you are here from the Selcan line ... 

507
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,560
 will come to your threshold, sir. 

508
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,180
 He will want to see you. 

509
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,860
 Selamun aleykum. 

510
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,760
 I Aleykümselam. 

511
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,500
 I Aleykümselam. 

512
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,320
 Say to Edebali Osman wants to discuss an important issue, dervish. 

513
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,100
 Thank you. 

514
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,920
 Mr. Osman! 

515
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,980
 Honey chick. 

516
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,560
 Thank goodness, I found you. 

517
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,700
 I was worried when he went unannounced. 

518
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,420
 Or... 

519
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
 ... is your father angry with me? 

520
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,780
 Osman Bey, who was born inside. 

521
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
 I know, I made a mistake. 

522
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,360
 I broke your heart. 

523
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,440
 I came here ... 

524
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,400
 ... so that I can kiss your hand and get halal. 

525
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,380
 My father, Osman Bey, does not turn away to the threshold. 

526
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,100
 Both ... 

527
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
 ... sorry for what you did. 

528
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,060
 He wishes to guide you. 

529
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,820
 My father is praised, he is our light. 

530
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,220
 I wouldn't want to grieve. 

531
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,180
 Do you know why you broke my dad? 

532
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,220
 I know, Bala chick. 

533
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,140
 I will fight for justice ... 

534
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,060
 I tried to be justice. 

535
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,760
 You thought right. 

536
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
 He will be happy to come. 

537
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,460
 God willing. 

538
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,080
 Hopefully Bala chick. 

539
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,440
 Let me see one face ... 

540
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,540
 ... let me get a prayer. 

541
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,380
 I have something to say to him. 

542
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,900
 Then you. 

543
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,460
 Until my father came ... 

544
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,460
 ... you are Mr. Osman. 

545
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,420
 We saw Selcan aunt. 

546
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,040
 I know. 

547
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,540
 Thanks to him I found you. 

548
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,440
 I was so scared that I would never see you again, Bala chick. 

549
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,100
 To ask you ... 

550
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,340
 ... I will send my aunt Selcan to the father. 

551
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,380
 Why did your face drop? 

552
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,660
 Selamun aleykum. 

553
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,320
 Hello, dervish. 

554
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,560
 You are welcome, Mr. Osman. 

555
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,940
 Nice, we saw. 

556
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,960
 I wish to see Edebali. 

557
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,100
 Sir is not available, Osman. 

558
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,880
 Does he know it's important? 

559
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,360
 Knows. 

560
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,360
 Let me see it. 

561
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,580
 Mr. Osman! 

562
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,660
 Be patient. 

563
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,380
 Patience is the door of the client. You know. 

564
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,160
 Your father closed the door to the face of the woman standing on the brink, Bala chick. 

565
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,820
 Now you... 

566
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,460
 ... are you angry with the hand that you held out? 

567
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,040
 Or are you angry with extending the hand that cannot be held? 

568
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,300
 I did all the mistakes and suffering now. 

569
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,600
 A hillock on the road overwhelmed you ... 

570
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,400
 but there are hundreds of mountains in front of you. 

571
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,620
 Surrendering doesn't work for me, Bala chick. 

572
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,800
 Then you will have to be patient. 

573
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,420
 Is our glaze cube full? 

574
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,180
 He must have had a little fever that is leaking water, sir. 

575
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,360
 Then it is necessary to waste. 

576
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,060
 Elbet my father knows Osman. 

577
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:28,940
 I know. 

578
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
 It is difficult to wait at the Vuslat gate. 

579
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,280
 I... 

580
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,300
 ... going to wait ... 

581
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,380
 I wait until my last breath. 

582
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,360
 As long as you wait? Let me know him. 

583
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,960
 I'll be your companion on my father's path. 

584
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,480
 For this reason, I wait until my last breath. 

585
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,420
 However, the road looks pretty difficult. You know. 

586
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,200
 If I lose my breath ... 

587
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,900
 ... you breathe. 

588
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,740
 As long as... 

589
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,520
 ... let me know that I have a companion on this road. 

590
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,380
 Then keep your heart fresh. 

591
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,240
 Waiting for a lifetime is companionship ... 

592
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,280
 ... I'll wait. 

593
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,240
 I'll be back, Bala chick. 

594
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,640
 You were just going to say something to me. 

595
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,300
 Aygül hatun ... 

596
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,660
 What happened to Aygül? 

597
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,860
 He came to me when he was a guest in his room. 

598
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,180
 Obi field of ... 

599
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,340
 ... he said you were in trouble too. 

600
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,540
 He warned me. 

601
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,580
 There is no need to get angry, Mr. Osman. 

602
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,920
 He is of your blood, of life. 

603
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,020
 What happens to Aygül? 

604
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,440
 It's not you, me, Osman. 

605
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,240
 So what? 

606
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,720
 You have the heart of the Aygül line. 

607
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,900
 You know my heart is with you, Bala hat. 

608
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,660
 Leave the Aygül issue to me. 

609
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,120
 Not that... 

610
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,860
 ... I didn't know that I had fallen over to Edebali to not want to see me. 

611
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,960
 I will wait patiently. 

612
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,820
 Excuse me, Bala chick. 

613
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,980
 [Master is not available, Osman.] 

614
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,320
 [Patience.] 

615
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
 [Patience is the door of the child, you know.] 

616
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,600
 Come on. 

617
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,380
 Come sit down like this. 

618
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:04,900
 Come. 

619
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,620
 There are important things your father will talk about, girl. 

620
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,340
 Listen with life. 

621
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:20,820
 My daughter... 

622
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,120
 ... at our ceremony ... 

623
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,300
 ... the daughter is the crown. 

624
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,860
 Because he... 

625
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,140
 ... is a guest who leaves when the time comes. 

626
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,340
 It's time for you, girl. 

627
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,640
 I would like ... 

628
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,480
 ... not on the hillside ... 

629
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,540
 ... put it in a pure place. 

630
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,840
 Kadir, be a valuable person. 

631
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,740
 Today... 

632
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:59,120
 ... in Kulucahisar, we were with Alişar bey. 

633
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,000
 You know... 

634
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,460
 ... his chick passed away. 

635
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,000
 As a spouse, he sees you well. 

636
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,400
 He asked me about his offer ... 

637
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,380
 I will ask you too, girl. 

638
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,320
 Is there a consent? 

639
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,980
 Your father asks you, my daughter. 

640
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,900
 As you see fit, dad. 

641
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,640
 My daughter... 

642
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:05,160
 ... your mouth says another, your eyes speak another. 

643
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,260
 Now you... 

644
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,040
 ... stay a little alone ... 

645
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,840
 ... you should think really. 

646
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,120
 Well. 

647
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,260
 Girl mind, goose mind Dündar. 

648
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,680
 Will it be left alone with such an important decision? 

649
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,240
 The rose of the garden without consent, chick. 

650
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,420
 My daughter... 

651
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,040
 ... not for sale at the new market stall. 

652
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,160
 Leave... 

653
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,160
 ... his own decision ... 

654
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,900
 ... let it be your own. 

655
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,320
 Look at the fire of those candles ... 

656
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,420
 ... Kalanos. 

657
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,580
 How timid and how they tremble. 

658
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,400
 If I blow, they will go out. 

659
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,740
 Our dreams will come true, darling. 

660
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:58,580
 We will come together from the right of the Turks. 

661
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,800
 Master Yannis will show us the way. 

662
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,980
 We are on that road ... 

663
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,360
 ... we will walk hand in hand. 

664
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,200
 As you look at me like this ... 

665
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,900
 ... as the fire of love burns in our hearts 

666
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,380
 ... we have enough, Sofia. 

667
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,000
 Why did this come? 

668
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,360
 The migration was flat, they would settle down. 

669
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,140
 Fifty tents ... 

670
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,540
 five hundred throats chick. 

671
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,920
 Anyway, our two sides don't come together. 

672
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,780
 Now... 

673
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,220
 ... and deal with them. 

674
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,560
 As soon as he came, he asked Osman. 

675
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,100
 There is no need to tell you Selcan hat. 

676
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,160
 Don't take your eyes off. 

677
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,880
 Welcome, aunt. 

678
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,540
 I found it nice, Mr. Dundar. 

679
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,380
 Here you go ... 

680
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,600
 ... these preparations were made for you. 

681
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,260
 God bless you. 

682
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,480
 The brother fought with the brother ... 

683
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,300
 ... he believed in eblehte. 

684
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,580
 Batu ... 

685
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,380
 ...Osman. 

686
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,100
 Say, is it true? 

687
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,200
 Does our quarrel have a brother fight? 

688
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,260
 No, aunt. 

689
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,960
 Honestly, not. 

690
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,660
 Not that... 

691
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,960
 Osman ruled without listening to me. 

692
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,220
 I Baturina ... 

693
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,580
 ... I was a sky-eyed valiant. 

694
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,200
 Let's ask Osman. 

695
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,040
 My aunt ... 

696
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,040
 ... let's never open this matter. 

697
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,660
 Don't let our taste go unnoticed. 

698
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,760
 My Day ... 

699
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,180
 ...My sun. 

700
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,320
 The trouble in the room is not by smoking ... 

701
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,380
 ... it is solved by going to it. 

702
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,740
 This matter is as fresh as Batur's wound, Selcan hatun. 

703
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,260
 If you scratch it will bleed. 

704
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,920
 I say scratching. 

705
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,440
 We came from the wake of Saime Ana, Zöhre chick. 

706
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,560
 I saw three gentlemen in my life. 

707
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,080
 I would say the wound is not to bleed ... 

708
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,260
 I want to treat. 

709
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,660
 Osman... 

710
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,260
 Is Batur right? 

711
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,540
 He grabbed me when I never expected. 

712
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,440
 I wouldn't expect this from Osman. 

713
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,380
 I Uthman ... 

714
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,840
 ... is it true what Batur said? 

715
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
 Toy Osmancık. 

716
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,940
 Ham Osmancık. 

717
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,300
 Who is thesis ... 

718
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,180
 ... his hard work will be less. 

719
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,440
 Know this like this. 

720
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,440
 It is true, aunt. 

721
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,340
 It is not error free ... 

722
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,840
 ...not that... 

723
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,520
 I was impulsive. 

724
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,420
 Osman. 

725
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,200
 I was a dark-eyed, wolf-eyed brave. 

726
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:00,060
 The mountain stone breaks the wind, and the brotherhood spoils. 

727
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,780
 I am a mountain-like son ... 

728
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,940
 ... and left my brave Gündoğdu. 

729
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:14,560
 I have no branch to hold on to you, no one, no one. 

730
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,960
 If you stand apart like this ... 

731
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,260
 ... which branch will I hold? 

732
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,060
 The nation of Oğuz is the demote of Dem Korkut. 

733
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,900
 Haram mixes zade, halal zade is reconciled. 

734
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,340
 Come on, hug each other. 

735
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,840
 You're done. 

736
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,040
 Meyyit pan, let the toy air. 

737
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,560
 Forgive me. 

738
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,740
 It is lawful. 

739
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,160
 Halal your right, his son. 

740
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,000
 Hay, thank you. 

741
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,420
 My aunt ... 

742
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,740
 .... you came with compassion. 

743
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,300
 May you be shaad. 

744
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,600
 Your room needed a main breath. 

745
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,060
 On a mother's lap ... 

746
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,460
 ... to the main kindness. 

747
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,860
 My daughter... 

748
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,780
 ... I see you very stagnant. 

749
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,320
 Come on. 

750
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,860
 I hope it's good. 

751
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,200
 I'm fine, dad. 

752
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,780
 I'm fine ... 

753
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,560
 ... I'm getting a little tired. 

754
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,540
 What is it that strikes my light into darkness? 

755
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,160
 Let's learn also. 

756
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,960
 Our father. 

757
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,740
 We are gadget wherever we go. 

758
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,500
 Games are being played behind us, in front of us. 

759
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,200
 I wonder, how will we leave? 

760
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:17,820
 He thinks that ... 

761
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,900
 ... I would get mad at it. 

762
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,000
 This was the case with your late mother Ulduz. 

763
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,560
 Something on my head is installed in the corner ... 

764
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,560
 ... would eat himself inside. 

765
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,520
 My daughter... 

766
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,880
 ... Balaam. 

767
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,020
 It is not for the shrinker, but for your heart. 

768
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,240
 The son of the person was folk from the blood clot, but ... 

769
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,480
 ... thankfully wholeheartedly. 

770
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,980
 The body is a mother-of-pearl, and the heart is a pearl. 

771
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:02,660
 Ten is an envelope, and the heart is a saving. 

772
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,700
 Heart... 

773
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,720
 ... is an immense land of plums, girl. 

774
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:15,000
 It is like a transfer that contains all healing. 

775
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,380
 If you find justice in the heart ... 

776
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,900
 .... you conscience. 

777
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,100
 If you find science in the heart ... 

778
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,460
 ... you will be wise. 

779
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:30,320
 If you find compassion in the heart ... 

780
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,260
 ... you will have mercy. 

781
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,880
 If you find love in the heart ... 

782
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,680
 ... serve. 

783
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:47,180
 The two world suns, as our Messenger of Allah commanded ... 

784
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,920
 ... "If our heart is strong, it will be solid in every business." 

785
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,760
 But... 

786
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,520
 ... it shouldn't have been this. 

787
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:09,620
 How long have you been worrying about yourself, for us, Bala hat? 

788
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,640
 His problem is his ... 

789
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,500
 ... as much trouble as the world. 

790
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,580
 A person is as human as his problem. 

791
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,300
 It is as big as trouble. 

792
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:35,020
 Besides the suffering of the Islamic world ... 

793
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,300
 ... is our concern? 

794
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,360
 One day, if your heart is troubled by all humanity ... 

795
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,940
 I hope our salvation was then. 

796
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:54,920
 May Allah make our hearts clean. 

797
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,360
 May Allah make our trouble great. 

798
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:05,560
 It is great that the devil does not invade our hearts. 

799
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:10,420
 May it be great that our hearts should not be lost. 

800
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,460
 Amine. 

801
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,960
 Don't talk until my heart cools down! 

802
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:27,580
 Do not! 

803
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,780
 I will start with your fingers first. 

804
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,940
 Now I will cut the eyelids. 

805
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,060
 Next, I will split your eyes into salt. 

806
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,340
 Brother, stop. 

807
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:12,900
 Boğaç, let go. 

808
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,400
 Stop, bro, stop! 

809
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,560
 Leave a bull! 

810
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,460
 Leave! 

811
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,840
 I will talk. 

812
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:21,800
 I will say. 

813
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,280
 I will say everything. 

814
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,340
 Narrative. 

815
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,140
 Tell me, die easily. 

816
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:28,860
 I'll tell you. 

817
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,220
 I will tell you everything. 

818
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,000
 Just don't give it to me. 

819
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,280
 Salvador will overwhelm Samsa's hat tomorrow. 

820
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,480
 They will meet their men in the caravanserai. 

821
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:48,960
 Well ... 

822
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,220
 ... how will we recognize that shroud? 

823
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,880
 There is a big sign behind his head. 

824
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,380
 Gamtural is! 

825
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,960
 Wait here, brother. 

826
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,500
 I will inform our brain. 

827
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,340
 Lets! 

828
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,800
 Ertuğrul the day my husband brought your late mother to the oba ... 

829
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,920
 ... yesterday I remember son. 

830
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,780
 They had survived many badgoods. 

831
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,440
 Not only did he come to his father, but to his late mother because he came to Oba. 

832
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,860
 Oh, rest in the light, Halimem. 

833
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,900
 He faced everything, to everyone. 

834
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,960
 Even me. 

835
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,360
 I used to say that you would follow your father's path. 

836
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,960
 You gave me my word, son. 

837
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:24,020
 You will be able to overcome the devils and evil of that devil called Yannis, insha'Allah. 

838
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,920
 You don't worry, aunt. 

839
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,040
 So, I will come to you from that devil. 

840
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:32,680
 I know. 

841
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,820
 Say, well. 

842
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,120
 What do you wish from your aunt? 

843
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,840
 I have a heart in the line of Bala, aunt. 

844
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:03,060
 Your eyes shout out, son. 

845
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,600
 Even when he speaks his name, your eyes sparkle. 

846
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,800
 Well, well. 

847
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,540
 What is your murad from me? 

848
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,320
 I want you to arrive at Edebali tomorrow. 

849
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,420
 Osm me. 

850
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:30,240
 I wish you to ask Bala's hat by order of Allah, aunt. 

851
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:36,200
 Thank goodness we have seen these days too. 

852
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,840
 Why would you send me while your father is standing, son? 

853
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,200
 My father's path is long, aunt. 

854
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,680
 I don't know when he will be back to our obese. 

855
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,280
 Both ... 

856
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,080
 I don't have patience. 

857
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,280
 When my father comes, we have a wedding. 

858
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,580
 Both ... 

859
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,760
 ... I have broken the heart of Edebali. 

860
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,040
 I got into situations that it couldn't suit me. 

861
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,760
 He warned me. 

862
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,860
 However, I realized late, aunt. 

863
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:22,980
 Uncle ... 

864
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,080
 ... will your son fall for me while your uncle is standing? 

865
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,840
 My uncle... 

866
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,440
 ... dad is half aunt. 

867
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,500
 Not that... 

868
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,700
 ...you are my mother. 

869
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,780
 Oh, I'm the victim. 

870
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:50,640
 What is the glory of Dundar when my mother is standing? 

871
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,860
 You don't worry. 

872
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,800
 Tomorrow I will go to that blessed man's door at thesis time. 

873
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,760
 Thank you, aunt. 

874
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,560
 There is another matter, aunt. 

875
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,400
 Say, well. 

876
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,680
 Aygul. 

877
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,720
 Your father closed the door to the face of the woman standing on the verge, Bala hat. 

878
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,900
 Love and mercy is a river in man Bala. 

879
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,320
 If it flows strong, evil cannot hold on. 

880
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:15,880
 Osman Beyde is like a river. 

881
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,160
 Thank God, both love and compassion are strong. 

882
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,360
 But a lot of chopper. 

883
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,280
 Impatient. 

884
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,640
 The Diddetl. 

885
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:37,860
 He said he would walk to his last breath in your companionship. 

886
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:41,160
 Don't you believe it? 

887
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,180
 I believe him to believe. 

888
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,300
 At that time? 

889
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,340
 My father left Osman on the edge of the cliff. 

890
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:01,720
 I am afraid that he will turn his eyes on the cliff, not on the road. 

891
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,820
 Mr. Osman! 

892
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,380
 Sabıred Basin. 

893
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,120
 Patience is the door of the child, you know. 

894
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,400
 Osman. 

895
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:55,980
 Suddenly Osman, holding on fire like a flame of flame. 

896
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,840
 Osmancik. 

897
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,860
 We just walk to you when you walk .... 

898
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:07,880
 ... laugh when you smile ... 

899
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:16,780
 ... when you resist the persecution, let's stand patience and let the people see the state. 

900
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,180
 what do you do? 

901
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,000
 Toy Osmancık. 

902
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:24,500
 Ham Osmancık. 

903
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:29,320
 The hard work of a person with a thesis is also low. 

904
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,640
 Is there any destim, sir? 

905
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,180
 You're coming. 

906
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,200
 Storm? 

907
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,920
 What are you doing here? 

908
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,740
 Where's the canteen? 

909
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:00,940
 I left it on the road, sir. 

910
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:02,380
 Why is that? 

911
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,080
 Why did you come? 

912
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,760
 Sir said he spoke. 

913
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,580
 Samsa would raid his brain obes, the Salvadoran shroud. 

914
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,620
 We couldn't leave you alone. 

915
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,220
 Wow they are unbelievers. 

916
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,860
 Samsa sergeant huh? 

917
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,640
 I would be if I don't take their lungs out and throw them into the pus. 

918
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,660
 I alps! 

919
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,980
 Let's get to the osa of Samsa sergeant. 

920
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,100
 The day is the account day. 

921
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:28,540
 Thank you. 

922
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,460
 Thank you sir. 

923
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,340
 Over the years... 

924
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,880
 ... kayı obasi has also changed, Aybüke. 

925
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,660
 It was both big and big. 

926
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,440
 It grew in trouble as it grew. 

927
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,940
 We are in the middle of these troubles, ma'am. 

928
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,580
 We came across precise time. 

929
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,760
 What did he get in the eye? 

930
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,720
 Zöhre chick. 

931
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,560
 As if he was not very happy with our development. 

932
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,380
 Why are you happy? 

933
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:38,740
 When he thinks, he plays a horse that has dropped his nephew to uncle and brother to brother. 

934
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,840
 They left my Osman alone. 

935
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,440
 He knows that I love you as my son. 

936
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,500
 He is concerned that I have come now. 

937
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,980
 Behind the gaze of the Zöhre line lies a well of grudge. 

938
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:57,120
 Don't you touch a gadget? 

939
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,740
 Dundar brainbed is what the Zöhre line sees. 

940
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:07,340
 What I see is three cycles, three cycles and three major migrations. 

941
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,040
 I have not bleached this hair for nothing. 

942
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:16,140
 His verdict only passes to new adolescents. 

943
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,300
 Not a plane like me. 

944
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,600
 Archers! 

945
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,460
 Shoot me. 

946
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:01,680
 The martyrdom is closer to us than ever before. 

947
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:09,520
 I don't look at the tears of the mistake, so you know this. 

948
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:18,820
 For a massive ceng ... 

949
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,800
 ... for a while we have given raids to the people. 

950
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,480
 The informal order has changed. 

951
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:31,760
 After that, we will protect our land, our obes, our honor. 

952
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,820
 Gentlemen at the head of the Turkish oba ... 

953
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
 is in heedlessness and signification. 

954
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,380
 Ceng will go and crash into the keel of the shroud. 

955
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:51,680
 Those who do not get their heads on ten times before reaching the martyrdom ... 

956
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:55,040
 ... there is no fame in my eyes. 

957
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
 I wouldn't leave your collar in the other world. 

958
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,280
 Is that clear? 

959
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,280
 Thank you, sir! 

960
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:15,900
 Everyone knows what to do. 

961
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,140
 The arrow thrown is three things that are not returned. 

962
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,220
 We will finish this job today. 

963
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:28,080
 We have a single arrow on the quiver! 

964
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,660
 We shot, we shot. 

965
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:37,080
 We couldn't hit it, we would get a troubled enemy, which in turn ... 

966
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,700
 ... leads to sleepless nights. 

967
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,200
 Did you understand me! 

968
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,720
 No, Selcan hatun. 

969
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
 Did something important happen? 

970
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,280
 I came to talk about Aygül hatun. 

971
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,940
 I will speak straight without bending and talking. 

972
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:17,800
 Have you ever bent and twisted? 

973
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,800
 It did not. 

974
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,940
 What happened to my daughter? 

975
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,220
 I know that Aygül has a heart in Osman. 

976
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:27,660
 Where did you hear this? 

977
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:29,780
 Now I see it in your eyes. 

978
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,620
 So I say right. 

979
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:33,780
 Now let me leave my eyes. 

980
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,140
 What do you mean? 

981
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,500
 Another chick lies in Osman's heart, Zöhre. 

982
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:44,900
 Osman's heart in Edebali's daughter ... 

983
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,900
 ... me and my daughter, we know. 

984
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:48,560
 What is it to me? 

985
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,300
 What about my daughter from this? 

986
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,920
 If so, why did Aygül threaten the Bala woman then? 

987
01:36:56,380 --> 01:37:01,820
 He said we don't want you around here, you put our obesity in danger. 

988
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:03,220
 My daughter says right. 

989
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,240
 But not because he has a heart in Osman. 

990
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,340
 For that chick and her father ... 

991
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:11,340
 He said he knew he would bring trouble. 

992
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,380
 Both ... 

993
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,900
 ... Aygül's heart is in Alişar bey. 

994
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,200
 Alışar bey with the order of Allah ... 

995
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,200
 ... Dundar asked my daughter for my daughter. 

996
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:26,440
 This matter is over here. 

997
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,040
 I'm glad about that. 

998
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:32,300
 God bless both of them. 

999
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,140
 Amine. 

1000
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:36,600
 Obviously, things have accumulated in Oba. 

1001
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,460
 I'll go and get the job done. 

1002
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,700
 [Sword sound.] 

1003
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,640
 I heard you were calling me Osman. 

1004
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:43,220
 You were looking for the killer of Aybars, whom I lay down. 

1005
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,480
 Come on, here I am. 

1006
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,040
 Salvador. 

1007
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:53,840
 Come on, let's see your account from man to man. 

1008
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,960
 When did you meet me as a man, Salvador? 

1009
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:01,080
 Is bravery in the tongue of pusat? 

1010
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,740
 How many men did you take for an Alp? 

1011
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,240
 Or did you think I would forget this? 

1012
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:09,940
 Now, you fell into my ambush. 

1013
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,740
 With us, until the soil is full of blood ... 

1014
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,740
 ... the fire of revenge does not go out. 

1015
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:20,000
 There's no death to you until you fill your carrion. 

1016
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,920
 Come on, God! 

1017
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,620
 Appreciate Allah! 

1018
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,340
 Attack! 

1019
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,680
 Alps! 

1020
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:46,300
 Erkut! 

1021
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:16,160
 Erkut! 

1022
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,000
 My brother! 

1023
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,880
 If you don't want the Alps to die, throw your sword at Osman. 

1024
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,620
 I will not say this once again. 

1025
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,800
 Bey. 

1026
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,460
 Right. 

1027
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:44,660
 Erkut. 

1028
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,820
 Erkut. 

1029
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:12,940
 You called me mom. 

1030
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,120
 Come on girl. 

1031
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,480
 Sit down I have something to say to you. 

1032
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:27,100
 I wanted to talk to you about Mr. Alişar. 

1033
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,240
 Your father won't let you marry him without your consent 

1034
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,960
 ... you know that too. 

1035
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:42,060
 However, you have to marry Alişar bey Aygül. 

1036
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,060
 Your father ... 

1037
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,340
 ...our 

1038
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,480
 ... obama our 

1039
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:58,540
 ... and even the fortune of your brother Batur depends on your decision. 

1040
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,600
 What do you say mom? 

1041
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,380
 What good? 

1042
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,040
 I'm your father's brothers. 

1043
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,180
 Mom, do you know what you're saying? 

1044
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:09,400
 Look girl. 

1045
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,360
 I'm a healer. 

1046
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,960
 Ertuğrul Bey has been sick for a long time. 

1047
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,500
 He hides it from everyone. 

1048
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:22,540
 I knew it, but I was silent. 

1049
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,780
 When the time comes, your father will be opened to the road. 

1050
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:30,460
 So what does this have to do with me, mom? 

1051
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,480
 Don't you know how vindictive Osman is? 

1052
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:38,580
 After all this, Osman will not forgive your father or brother. 

1053
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:47,000
 If Beylik is not your father, Osman will sooner than later. 

1054
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:49,660
 Nobody can prevent this. 

1055
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,540
 Except for Alişar bey. 

1056
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,380
 Did you understand me? 

1057
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,900
 I prepared you a blood feast, Osman. 

1058
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,180
 Even you will not be saved. 

1059
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,880
 No! 

1060
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,180
 No! 

1061
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,260
 Where's the literary? 

1062
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:11,420
 Osman Bey, do not say anything to this voyage. 

1063
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:12,920
 Iron bending. 

1064
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,080
 My dear victim. 

1065
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,640
 Iron bending! 

1066
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,960
 This was very pathetic. 

1067
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,520
 Eşhedü enla ilaha illallah. 

1068
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,820
 No! 

1069
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,460
 And the covenant and the Messenger of Allah. 

1070
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,660
 No! 

1071
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,800
 No! 

1072
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:59,600
 At sunrise, at sunset. 

1073
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,300
 Every moment you don't tell the place of the literary ... 

1074
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,720
 ... I will cut the throat of one of the Alps. 

1075
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:10,220
 We are going! 

1076
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,080
 Iron bending. 

1077
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,540
 Iron bending. 

1078
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,020
 Erkut! 

1079
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,180
 That... 

1080
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,740
 ...That. 

1081
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:00,420
 Shut up! 

1082
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,840
 I said everything you wanted. 

1083
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:11,040
 A little water. 

1084
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,840
 If Samsa happens to the brain ... 

1085
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,400
 ... I'll swim and salt your skin. 

1086
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,380
 That... 

1087
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:08,660
 Does this rug fit on the looms of the chicks of apricot obese? 

1088
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:11,880
 Our main ... 

1089
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,620
 ... When are the daughters of Hayme chicks, Halime chicks 

1090
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:19,480
 ... stop weaving rugs and became shoddy ties? 

1091
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,900
 We sat at the counter at sunrise. 

1092
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:33,140
 We woke up at sunset. 

1093
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:36,960
 At night, we used the pomegranate to our fingers. 

1094
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,240
 Just to let it rest. 

1095
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,880
 Come on. 

1096
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,100
 Give up, Zöhre chick. 

1097
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,000
 Do I say much? 

1098
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:52,960
 Do you make these rugs fit on the rugs? 

1099
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:54,920
 You have a right. 

1100
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:57,520
 However, nothing is as before. 

1101
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:00,720
 The place where we collect root dyes is willow. 

1102
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:06,060
 If you boil it for days, it will not give full color, it will not hold the paint. 

1103
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:11,040
 Ecel came to the world, headache excuse. 

1104
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,100
 I know.. 

1105
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,620
 .. the ambition of the snow is over. 

1106
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:21,720
 Babes! 

1107
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:23,540
 My Sisters! 

1108
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:26,640
 Is it very difficult to find the grasses that are less or less? 

1109
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:31,360
 Is it very difficult to weave the best of the rug? 

1110
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:37,080
 We continue together from the place left by Hayme mother. 

1111
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,360
 I know... 

1112
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:43,860
 ... the daughters of Kayi Oba have separate skills in each finger. 

1113
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,360
 Now let them see. 

1114
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:50,960
 What ingenuity will the chicks of the Kayı oba. 

1115
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,740
 I know. 

1116
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,500
 Such rugs will be woven on these looms. 

1117
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,000
 Yeah. 

1118
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,580
 That's right. 

1119
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:59,940
 Even you will not look back at what you have touched before. 

1120
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,840
 We met you again, Selcan hatun. 

1121
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,360
 Welcome. 

1122
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,520
 Mr. Dundar, you are right here. 

1123
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,100
 Zöhre chick. 

1124
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,040
 We came here to crown peace. 

1125
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:22,180
 We came as a friend. 

1126
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:26,960
 You wanted to see the rugs, princess. 

1127
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:28,620
 Here Basin. 

1128
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,460
 Let's see... 

1129
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:53,120
 Osman Bey, they could not finish praise 

1130
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,640
 how durable was it? 

1131
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,780
 Say my hands ... 

1132
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,680
 ... let's see this all together 

1133
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,520
 What does that heart look for in this baby son? 

1134
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:13,840
 These are ... 

1135
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:18,000
 ... they know how to kidnap chickens from the market for money. 

1136
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,020
 Then in ... 

1137
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:22,780
 ... they roam because I am brave. 

1138
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,220
 Enough talk about it! 

1139
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:27,420
 Tell me your money and we'll give you the amount. 

1140
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,600
 Sold dog! 

1141
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:33,880
 Ah! 

1142
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,740
 Lord! 

1143
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:39,380
 Mr. Osman! 

1144
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:44,780
 Deyyuz! 

1145
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,700
 Sold dog! 

1146
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,480
 It will be your turn. 

1147
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:01,740
 Do not hurry. 

1148
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:10,060
 Where's the literary? 

1149
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,200
 Where's the literary? 

1150
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,940
 Where you will die! 

1151
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,460
 Give it! 

1152
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,440
 Lord! 

1153
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:35,760
 Come on, God! 

1154
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,200
 Mr. Osman! 

1155
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,140
 Lord! 

1156
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,040
 Mr. Osman! 

1157
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,340
 Where's the literary? 

1158
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:37,960
 Where's the literary? 

1159
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:42,160
 Where's the literary? 

1160
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:28,660
 He slipped into his sleepy sleep. 

1161
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:19,940
 Father. 

1162
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:27,980
 No, I hope. 

1163
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:35,620
 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. 

1164
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,420
 Osman. 

1165
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:49,900
 What happened to Osman, Dad? 

1166
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:55,380
 Tell the dervishes, girl. 

1167
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:59,340
 Let them walk through the forest thoroughly. 

1168
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,320
 Horse of the canteen. 

1169
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:57,200
 What are you up to, Osman? 

1170
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,120
 Who are you? 

1171
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:38,000
 I have an important offer for you, Mr. Dundar. 

1172
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,540
 Tell me. 

1173
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,620
 Mr. Alişar is ambitious. 

1174
02:02:46,060 --> 02:02:49,800
 But we can both do bigger things. 

1175
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,960
 You travel in dangerous waters, Kalanos. 

1176
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:01,620
 Don't you know, Alişar without brain news ... 

1177
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:05,220
 ... even the leaf does not move in the end soil. 

1178
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,640
 Alişar bey is nothing without us. 

1179
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,900
 I know that well, Mr. Dundar. 

1180
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:19,720
 Beyond that, Kalanos. 

1181
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,280
 The market is only in willow ... 

1182
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,540
 ... not in Eskihisar. 

1183
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,800
 There are markets waiting to revive in our land. 

1184
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,560
 These markets ... 

1185
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,960
 ... poor and weak. 

1186
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:33,320
 But... 

1187
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:35,160
 ... both of us 

1188
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:40,760
 ... by reviving the markets in Byzantium and earning our profits 

1189
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:43,680
 ... we can add strength to our strength. 

1190
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:49,680
 What do you say? 

1191
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,480
 Your Rug ... 

1192
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:09,420
 ... Your weaving 

1193
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:13,720
 ... among the bestsellers in Constantinople. 

1194
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:20,220
 It means that people of Constantinople understand the good of the rug. 

1195
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:23,700
 What do you wish, princess? 

1196
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,160
 Increasing your rugs ... 

1197
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,500
 ... producing more goods 

1198
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:45,240
 ... we would like to sell it directly in Constantinople. 

1199
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:49,300
 More rugs mean ... 

1200
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,360
 ... more girls 

1201
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,980
 ... more countertops. 

1202
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,800
 We are ready to give whatever it takes. 

1203
02:04:57,560 --> 02:04:59,760
 We do it together with Selcan hatun. 

1204
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,260
 Isn't that right, babe? 

1205
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:05,300
 If you are going to stay here, gold is important. 

1206
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:06,940
 Hea ... 

1207
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:09,800
 ... if the gold was with maple ... 

1208
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:12,980
 ... they wouldn't get stuck in stone castles. 

1209
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:21,080
 I will still think. 

1210
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:40,880
 Ya Allah. 

1211
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,060
 Ya Allah. 

1212
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:47,360
 My brother. 

1213
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,200
 Live! 

1214
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:50,920
 Live! 

1215
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,300
 My brother. 

1216
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:55,040
 My brother. 

1217
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,600
 Osman kidnapped the gentleman. 

1218
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:02,540
 Inform the thesis oba. 

1219
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:04,500
 Go to the thesis and inform our master. 

1220
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,140
 I will carry the injured to the plains. 

1221
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,300
 Okay brother. 

1222
02:06:09,620 --> 02:06:10,480
 OK. 

1223
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,000
 Deh! 

1224
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:15,860
 Deh! 

1225
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:17,800
 Gee. 

1226
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:37,600
 I saw that ... 

1227
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,800
 ... your Aps give you so much value. 

1228
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:43,720
 Let's see... 

1229
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:46,620
 ... which of them do you value more? 

1230
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,160
 Or is this a combative one? 

1231
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,860
 Bloodless! 

1232
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:37,860
 You will account for what they have. 

1233
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,280
 Demon. 

1234
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,800
 Esbab demon. 

1235
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:51,100
 You're gonna die. 

1236
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,460
 Or... 

1237
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,720
 is this wild? 

1238
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,560
 He even has a war wound on his face. 

1239
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:04,400
 I am sorry that you will die impotently. 

1240
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:05,780
 But... 

1241
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:08,920
 Osman will tell when he will die. 

1242
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:10,240
 Ha Osman? 

1243
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,380
 Tell me ... 

1244
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:15,160
 ...which? 

1245
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:23,240
 I mean, the lovers ... 

1246
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:26,460
 ... Yusuf's dungeon was dark. 

1247
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,700
 That dark dungeon ... 

1248
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:31,240
 ... in the garden of light 

1249
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:33,500
 Was Yusuf's faith. 

1250
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:36,240
 What makes Joseph supreme ... 

1251
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:37,880
 what a well ... 

1252
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:39,880
 what Egypt, 

1253
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:41,940
 nor dungeon. 

1254
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:45,860
 To get rid of the well to the light ... 

1255
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,660
 ... edict to get out of the dungeon 

1256
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:52,040
 ... to become a sultan in Egypt 

1257
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:54,620
 ... ideas may be needed. 

1258
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,280
 Not that... 

1259
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:58,300
 ... to be like Yusuf 

1260
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,660
 ... faith is needed. 

1261
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,640
 Amenna. 

1262
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:07,740
 Faith... 

1263
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,720
 ... obvious to the victor 

1264
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,840
 ... the Iraqi one is near 

1265
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,060
 ... makes the defeated victorious. 

1266
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,680
 May Allah make us free from the outside. 

1267
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,440
 Amine. 

1268
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:28,540
 Yenipazar raid ... 

1269
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,940
 ... in terms of the trust of the region 

1270
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:32,900
 ... has been bad. 

1271
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:34,360
 Not that... 

1272
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:36,560
 ... when the market is re-established 

1273
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,180
 ... informal from us 

1274
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,760
 ... as it will not open the counter. 

1275
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:42,380
 The Edebali ... 

1276
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:49,240
 There is literary, Dundar bey. 

1277
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,780
 Did you say craft or trade? 

1278
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:54,540
 ... come to mind. 

1279
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,720
 Ahi means trouble. 

1280
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,700
 For everyone... 

1281
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:01,440
 ... means a big trouble. 

1282
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,740
 Neither me nor Alişar ... 

1283
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:06,520
 ... we can't include him. 

1284
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:10,820
 The End of the ... 

1285
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,160
 ... and even the absence of merchants ... 

1286
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
 ... to turn it into an opportunity. 

1287
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:17,680
 My nephew... 

1288
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:20,040
 ... keep your work tight. 

1289
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:22,740
 The pain of the people is still fresh, uncle. 

1290
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:25,760
 Even the blood in the marketplace did not dry out. 

1291
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:27,220
 Dominant ... 

1292
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:28,960
 ... use it in our favor 

1293
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:30,860
 ... it won't work for us. 

1294
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:34,300
 This is not use, my nephew. 

1295
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:36,040
 Both ... 

1296
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,280
 ... do you think I'm not upset? 

1297
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:40,760
 So many people ... 

1298
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:44,240
 ... to eat grief and drink my tears? 

1299
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:47,480
 As soon as possible to revive the market ... 

1300
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:50,160
 ... to serve the people of the people. 

1301
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:52,540
 Besides, everyone has seen that ... 

1302
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:55,920
 ... the market without the apricot Alps under my auspices ... 

1303
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:59,760
 ... is also suitable for hanging. 

1304
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:01,720
 This is ... 

1305
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:06,120
 ... will increase the inclination to us. 

1306
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:10,620
 Is Dundar the same decision as you in Sofia? 

1307
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:19,200
 Sofia ... 

1308
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:22,920
 ... made a promise to me with his commander Kalanos. 

1309
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:25,220
 The late wife, Yorgo Pulos ... 

1310
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,020
 ... will go its way. 

1311
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:31,700
 I wish the alliance with the enemy is as much as you think ... 

1312
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:34,820
 ... if you thought about Sheikh Edebiyi who came to our lands. 

1313
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:44,180
 Do not forget that Gundogdu and his son Mongol took it. 

1314
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:47,640
 Literary has taken trouble wherever he went. 

1315
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:50,800
 Informally, we don't want bloodshed. 

1316
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,780
 Don't worry, Zöhre chick. 

1317
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:55,940
 Evelallah. the blood to flow does not stop in the vein. 

1318
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:02,040
 I hope it is good? 

1319
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,600
 I hope it is good? 

1320
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:41,760
 Is there a destruction, Mr. Dundar? 

1321
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:44,840
 Abdurrahman. 

1322
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:46,740
 My father? 

1323
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:52,000
 My brother? 

1324
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,960
 Come on Abdurrahman Gazi. 

1325
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:10,500
 Selamun aleykum. 

1326
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,640
 I Aleykümselam. 

1327
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:28,440
 Where is my brother Abdurrahman Gazi? 

1328
02:13:34,580 --> 02:13:36,560
 Don't shut up, Abdurrahman Gazi. 

1329
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:39,660
 What is my father's death? 

1330
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:49,380
 Abdurrahman Gazi? 

1331
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:54,620
 Ertuğrul Beyim from Konya to Kayseri ... 

1332
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:56,980
 ... we went to the doctor with many men. 

1333
02:13:58,300 --> 02:14:01,960
 Doctors in Kayseri, Gevher Sultan Hospital. 

1334
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:05,140
 ... the disease is in your lungs. 

1335
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,320
 Treatment is required. 

1336
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,820
 They said to stay here for a while. 

1337
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:18,960
 I hope its healing is Allah. 

1338
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:20,120
 God willing. 

1339
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:21,220
 God willing. 

1340
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:26,560
 Father.. 

1341
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:38,220
 Sir, is there a destur? 

1342
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:40,200
 You're a pehlican dervish. 

1343
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:43,040
 Osman Bey and his Alps are lurking in the forest. 

1344
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:46,880
 They were caught and taken away. 

1345
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:53,400
 Who did this? 

1346
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,960
 We don't know, sir. 

1347
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:03,900
 Prepare my pusat. 

1348
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:14,400
 Yarenler! 

1349
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:19,000
 The day is not a flirty but a day of flesh 

1350
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:24,160
 We will not put Osman alone. 

1351
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:27,260
 It is forbidden to us to stop informally, father. 

1352
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:40,800
 Ertuğrul beyim thinks of the oba even in that state. 

1353
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:45,140
 He is afraid that the work of the stool will be delayed 

1354
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:52,860
 Ertuğrul, the son of Süleyman Shah, is the command of the brain; 

1355
02:15:55,060 --> 02:15:56,560
 My brother Dundar ... 

1356
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,620
 ... he said to be my deputy. 

1357
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:10,240
 My sons ... 

1358
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:11,700
 ... their uncle, 

1359
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,800
 ... My guys, 

1360
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:16,780
 ... swear to your aghas. 

1361
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,780
 “Make things easy,” he said. 

1362
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:46,640
 Happy birthday, Dundar bey. 

1363
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:57,320
 The magnificence of the principality ... 

1364
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:59,660
 ... the pot of might 

1365
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:01,820
 ... your pusat be sharp, sir. 

1366
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,560
 I want my pus ... 

1367
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:07,540
 ... I knew it in your eyes. 

1368
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:10,500
 May you exist, babe. 

1369
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:11,800
 May you exist. 

1370
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:23,920
 Good luck my father 

1371
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:26,000
 Thank you, girl. 

1372
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:34,280
 May Allah make it clear, sir. 

1373
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:36,140
 Thank you, girl. 

1374
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:47,220
 The principality ... 

1375
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:50,060
 Happy birthday, my father. 

1376
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:52,780
 Thank you son. 

1377
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,000
 May Allah help you and your uncle. 

1378
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:17,960
 It is my father's order. 

1379
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:21,580
 It pays you allegiance ... 

1380
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:24,540
 I wish to make your job easier. 

1381
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:25,840
 My brother... 

1382
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:28,880
 ... standing on his horse 

1383
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,320
 ... will enter this plague. 

1384
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,280
 You don't drop your face. 

1385
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:13,160
 Since... 

1386
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:17,600
 ... Ertuğrul is my order 

1387
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:22,240
 ... it is our duty to pay allegiance. 

1388
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:24,340
 Mr. Dundar. 

1389
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,380
 Happy, Mr. Dundar. 

1390
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:17,760
 My brother... 

1391
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:19,380
 Is there any destim, sir? 

1392
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:21,860
 Come Yaman. 

1393
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:26,060
 Bey. 

1394
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:29,080
 They brought serious injuries to the Erkut alpi. 

1395
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:34,820
 Iron bending was martyred. 

1396
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:36,860
 How about you? 

1397
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,120
 What do you say? 

1398
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:39,360
 Where is my Osman? 

1399
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,620
 Where are the other alps? 

1400
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:44,700
 They took them all away. 

1401
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:52,480
 Kill me. 

1402
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:53,940
 Kill me. 

1403
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:55,060
 Kill. 

1404
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:57,180
 Down with the dog! 

1405
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,740
 Kill me! 

1406
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:08,700
 If... 

1407
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:11,340
 ... if you don't kill me now, 

1408
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:14,120
 ... your lungs 

1409
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:17,860
 ... I remove it with my teeth and feed it to the thighs. 

1410
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:19,620
 If you want so much ... 

1411
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,360
 Stop Salvador! 

1412
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:35,340
 Leave! 

1413
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:56,620
 Let's enjoy their death. 

1414
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,940
 Princess Sofia.
